            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Al are wedded to their own wils, and overween their ſelf-worth by nature, which is tolerable being indeclinable: but to break the bonds of charity, is contrary to the common rules of Chriſtianity and damnable. Liſten how the Catholic Moderator checks al contenders about Articles of Religion, and givs good counſil in theſ metres:</p>

            </lg>
            <p>My chief comfort in this caſe is, what ſom cenſure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
<pb facs="tcp:168435:8"/> others wil confirm or commend: but <hi>Caeſars jacta eſt alea</hi> is the beſt bulwork of a reſolut ſpirit. If any be apt to quarrel, he ſhal fight a Sciomachy with his own ſhadow, and be anſwered in ſupine ſilence: for his teen wil be ſpent on a ſenſleſſ ſtock that regards it not, nor wil accept his chalenge, being ſupernnited to fight combats. So many Sects ſwarm abroad, and al ſo partial to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; that if any ſhal ſeem to croſſ their Tenets, they are ready to gnaſh their teeth, and ſtone him with bitter cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or calumnies (as the Jews ſerved <hi>Stephan</hi>) which is the diſmal deſtiny of al writers: but I hope for better things from the godly.

If any can cure Peoples ſpiritual pride or philauty in themſelfs; carnal affection or partiality toward their Faction; and Infernal hatred or prejudicacy againſt others (al three or either) he ſhal be more famous then <hi>Apollo, Aeſoulapius,</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and hav

Over-weening expectation is a main Enimy to al writers; but factious emulation and previous prejudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much more: when men prepoſtrouſly devov others works to <hi>Vulcan</hi> or <hi>Stercutins,</hi> yer they ſee the Sun.

            <p n="1">Article 1. THere is but one only tru living God, everlaſting, without body, parts or paſſions, of infinit power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: maker and preſerver of al things both viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: in unity of which Godhead ther be three Perſons of one ſubſtance, power, and eternity; the Father, Son, and holy-Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">Article 2. The Son who is the Word of the Father begot of him from everlaſting (the very eternal God of one ſubſtance with the Father) took mans Nature in the womb of the bleſſed virgin of hir ſubſtance, ſo that two whol perfect Natures (the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Manhood) were joined in one Perſon never to be ſevered, wherof one Chriſt conſiſts perfect God and very Man: who ſuffered, was crucified, dead, and buried to reconcile his Father to us, and be a ſacrifice not only for Original guilt, but alſo for al actual ſins of men.</p>
            <p n="3">Article 3. As Chriſt died for us and was buried: ſo 'tis to be beleeved, that he went down into Hel.</p>
            <p n="4">Article 4. Chriſt truly roſe from death and took again his body, with fleſh, bones, and al things pertaining to the perfection of Mans Nature: wherwith he aſcended into Heaven, and ther ſits til he ſhal return to judg al men at laſt day.</p>
            <p n="5">Article 5. The holy Ghoſt proceding from the Father and the Son, is one ſubſtance, majeſty, and glory with the Father and Son; very eternal God.</p>
            <p n="6">Article 6. Holy Scripture contains al things neceſſary for Salvation; ſo that whatever is not read therin, nor may be proved therby; is not required of any man to be beleeved as an Article of Faith, or be thought needful to ſalvation. By the name of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we underſtand thoſ Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, whoſ authority the Church never doubted of, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168435:10"/> the other Books (as ſaint <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith) the Church reads for exemple of life and inſtruction of maners, but doth not apply them to ſtabliſh any Doctrin. All the Books of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as commonly received, we receiv and reput them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical. See their names and number in the holy Bible.</p>
            <p n="7">Article 7. The old Teſtament is not contrary to the New; for in both everlaſting life is offred to mankind by Chriſt, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man; Therfore they are not to be heard, which fain that the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers looked only for tranſitory promiſes, though the Law given of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> touching Ceremonies or Rites doo not bind Chriſtians, nor the civil precepts of neceſſity to be received in any Chriſtian Commonwealth; yet no Chriſtian man whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is free from obedience of the Commandements caled moral.</p>
            <p n="8">Article 8. The three Creeds (<hi>Nicen, Athanaſius,</hi> and that commonly caled the Apoſtles) ought throughly to be received and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for theſ may be proved by moſt certain warrants of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="9">Article 9. Original ſin ſtands not in imitating <hi>Adam</hi> (as the Pelagians vainly talk) but is the fault and corruption of every mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is ingendred of <hi>Adams</hi> ofspring: wherby man is far gon from original Righteouſnes, and inclined to evil: ſo that the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and therfore in every perſon born into the world, it deſervs Gods wrath and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationthis infection of Nature remains, yea in the Regenerat, wherby the luſt of the fleſh (caled in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which ſom expound the wiſdom, ſom the ſenſuality, ſom the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſom the deſire of the fleſh, is not ſubject to the Law of God, and though ther is no condemnation to them that beleev and are baptized, yet the Apoſtle confeſſeth, that Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath of it ſelf the nature of Sin.</p>
            <p n="10">Article 10. The condition of man after <hi>Adam's</hi> fal is ſuch, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn or prepare himſelf by his natural ſtrength and good works to Faith, for we hav no power to doc good or pleaſ God, without his grace preventing us: that we may hav a good wil, and working when we hav that wil.</p>
            <p n="11">Article 11. We are accompted righteous before God, only for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, not for our
<pb facs="tcp:168435:11"/> own works or deſervings: which is a moſt wholſom doctrin very ful of comfort.</p>
            <p n="12">Article 12. Albeit works (which are fruits of Faith, and follow juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) cannot put away our ſins and endure the ſeverity of Gods judgement, yet are they pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt, and doo ſpring neceſſarily from a tru lifely Faith: inſomuch that by them a lifely Faith may be ſo evidently known as a Tree diſcerned by the fruit.</p>
            <p n="13">Article 13. Works doon before the Grace of Chriſt and juſtification of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, for as much as they ſpring not from Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, nor doo they make men meet to receiv Grace, or (as School-writers ſay) deſerv Grace of congruity: yea rather becauſ they are not doon as God hath willed and commanded to be doon; we doubt not but they hav the nature of ſin.</p>
            <p n="14">Article 14. Voluntary works over and abov Gods Commandements (caled works of ſupererogation) cannot be taught without arrogance and impiety, for by them men declare they doo not only render to God ſo much as they are bound to doo for themſelfs; but doo more for his ſake then of duty is required, which ſhal tranſcend to ſav others: wheras Chriſt ſaith plainly, When yee hav doon al which is commanded, ſay we be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants.</p>
            <p n="15">Article 15. Chriſt in truth of our Nature, is made like to us in al things except only ſin; from which he was cleerly void both in Life and Spirit, he is the Lamb without ſpot, who by ſacrifice of himſelf once made, took away the ſins of the World, and no ſin (as ſaint <hi>John</hi> ſaith) was in him: but we although baptiſed and born again, yet offend in many things, and if we ſay we hav no ſin, we deceiv our ſelfs, and no truth remains in us.</p>
            <p n="16">Article 16. Not every deadly ſin willingly committed after Baptiſm, is ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and unpardonable: wherfore the grant of Repentance may not be denied to ſuch as fal into Sin after B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mend our lifes: therfore they are to be condemned, which ſay they can ſin no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168435:11"/> more ſo long as they liv here being once juſtified, or deny place of forgivnes to ſuch as truly repent.</p>
            <p n="17">Article 17. Predeſtination to life is Gods everlaſting purpoſ, wherby before the worlds foundation, he conſtantly decreed by his Counſil ſecret to us, to deliver from curſ and damnation thoſ whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of mankind; and to bring them by Chriſt to everlaſting Salvation, as veſſels made to honor. Therfore they which are indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d with ſo excellent a benefit, be caled according to Gods purpoſ by his Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in du ſeaſon: they through Grace obey the caling, are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified freely, made ſons of God by Adoption, like the Image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, walk Religiouſly in good works, and at length by Gods mercy attain everlaſting felicity. as the godly conſideration of Predeſtination and Election in Chriſt, is ful of ſweet, pleaſant, unſpeakable comfort to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons, and ſuch as feel the working of Chriſts Spirit, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the works of the fleſh and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high Heavenly things: aſwel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ it doth greatly eſtabliſh and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoied by Chriſt, as bicauſ it fervently kindles their lov toward God: ſo for curious carnal perſons lacking his Spirit, to hav the Sentence of Gods Predeſtination conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualy before their eys, is a moſt dangerous downfal, wherby the Devil thruſts them into deſperation or rechleſnes of moſt unclean living, no leſs perilous then deſpair. Farthermore we muſt receiv Gods promiſes, as they be generaly ſet forth in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and that wil of God is to be folowed in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which is expreſly declared to us in his word.</p>
            <p n="18">Article 18. They are alſo to be had accurſed, who preſum that every man ſhal be ſaved by the Law or Sect which he profeſſeth, ſo that he be devour and diligent to frame his life according to that Law and Light of Nature: for holy Scripture ſets out unto us only the name of Jeſus Chriſt, wherby we muſt be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="19">Article 19. Chriſts viſible Church is a congregation of faithful men, in which Gods Word is purely preached, and Sacraments duly adminiſtred according to Chriſts Ordinance, in al things of neceſſity r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="20">Article 20. The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in controverſies of Faith: yet is it not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing contrary to Gods Word, nor may it ſo expound any place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; wherfore tho the Church be a witnes and Keeper of holy writ: yet as it may not decree any thing againſt the ſame, ſo ought it not to enforce any thing beſid it, as an Article to be beleeved for neceſſity of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="21">Article 21. General Councils may not be gathered without command and wil of Princes: when they are gathered (being but an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of men, and al not guided by the Spirit and Word of God) they may er, and ſom times hav erred in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God. Wherfore things ordained by them as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, hav neither ſtrength nor authority, unles it may be declared that they are taken out of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="22">Article 22. The Romiſh Doctrins touching Purgatory, Pardons, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping both Images and Reliques, and Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented and grounded on no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to Gods word,</p>
            <p n="23">Article 23. It is not lawfull for any man to undertake the office of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Preaching, or miniſtring the Sacraments before he be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully caled and ſent to execut the ſame: ſuch we ought to judg lawfully caled and ſent, which be choſen or caled to this work by men that hav public authority given them in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to cal and ſend miniſters or laborers into the Lord's Vineyard.</p>
            <p n="24">Article 24. 'Tis flatly repugnant to Gods word and primitiv Churches practiſ, to hav public Praier or Sacraments miniſtred in a toung not underſtood of the People.</p>
            <p n="25">Article 25. Sacraments ordained by Chriſt, be not only ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ges or tokens of Chriſtian mens profeſſion; but rather ſure witneſſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual ſigns of Grace and Gods good will toward us, by which he works inviſibly in us: and not only quicken, but alſo ſtrengthen and confirm our faith in him. There be two Sacraments ordained by Chriſt in the Goſpel; <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168435:12"/> and the Lords Supper: thoſ fiv commonly caled Sacraments (Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, extrem Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) are not properly Goſpel Sacraments; being ſuch as hav grown up partly of corrupt interpreting the Apoſtles, and partly are ſtates of life alowed in Scripture; but hav not like nature of Sacraments with the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>het two: for they hav no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign or Element ordained by God. The Sacraments were not inſtituted by Chriſt to be gazed on or carried about; but that we ſhould duly uſe them, and in ſuch only as receiv them worthily, they hav a wholſom effect or operation: but they that receiv the ſame unworthily, purchas to themſelfs damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p n="26">Article 26. Though in the viſible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and ſomtime hav chief authority in miniſtration of the word and Sacraments: yet ſith they doo not the ſame in their own name but in Chriſts, and miniſter by his Commiſſion or authority, we may uſe their miniſtry, both in hearing Gods word and receiving the Sacraments; nor is the effect of Chriſts Ordinances taken away by their wickednes, nor the grace of Gods gifts impaired from ſuch as by Faith rightly receiv the Sacraments miniſtred to them: which are effectual by reaſon of Chriſts inſtitution and promiſſ, tho they be miniſtred by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil men.

            <p n="27">Article 27. Baptiſm is not only a ſign of Profeſſion, and mark of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; wherby Chriſtians are diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rgivnes, and our adoption to be ſons of God by the holy Ghoſt, are viſibly ſigned and ſealed, Faith confirmed, and Grace increaſed by virtu of praier to God. The Baptiſm of young Infants in any wiſe is to be retained in the Church, as moſt conſonant to Chriſts inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="28">Article 28. The Lords Supper is not only a ſign of Chriſtians lov, which they ought to hav among themſelfs, but rather a Sacrament of
<pb facs="tcp:168435:13"/> our Redemption by Chriſts death: ſo that to ſuch as worthily receiv the ſame, the Bread which we break is partaking of Chriſts body, and the cup of Bleſſing is a partaking of his Blood. Tranſubſtantiation or change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, cannot be proved by holy Writ, but repugns the plain words of Scripture, overthrows the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and givs occaſion to ſundry ſuperſtitions. Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after a ſpiritual heavenly maner; and the mean wherby 'tis received and earen is Faith. This Sacrament by Chriſts Ordinance, was not reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, carried about, lifted up, or worſhipped.</p>
            <p n="29">Article 29. The wicked and ſuch as be void of life by Faith, tho they doo carnaly and viſibly preſſ with their teeth (as ſaint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood: yet in no wiſe are partakers of Chriſt; but rather doo eat and drink the Sign or Sacrament of ſo great a thing to their condemnation.</p>
            <p n="30">Article 30. The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to lay people: for both parts of the Lords Sacrament; by Chriſts Ordinance and commandement ought to be adminiſtred unto al Chriſtian men.</p>
            <p n="31">Article 31. The Offering of Chriſt once made, is that right perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Propitiation, and Satisfaction for al ſins of the whol world, both Original and Actual, and ther is no other ſatisfaction but that alone. Wherfore the Sacrifices of Maſſes, in which it was commonly ſaid the Prieſts did offer Chriſt for quick and dead, to hav remiſſion of pain and guilt; are blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fables and dangerous deceipts.</p>
            <p n="32">Article 32. Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons are not commanded by Gods Law either to vow the eſtate of ſingle life, or to abſtain from mariage: but 'tis alſo lawful for them, as for al other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men, to marry at their own diſcretion; as they ſhal judg it to ſerv better to godlines.</p>
            <p n="33">Article 33. That perſon which by open denunciation of the Church, is rightly cut off from the unity therof and excommunicat, ought to be taken by the multitud of the whol Faithful as an Heathen or Publican, til he be openly reconciled by penance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church by a Judg that hath authority therto.</p>
            <p n="34">Article 34. It is not neceſſary that Traditions and Ceremonies be one or utterly like in al places: for they hav bin diverſ and changed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168435:13"/> at al times, according to diverſity of Countries, Times, and mens maners; ſo that nothing be ordained againſt Gods word. Who ever doth willingly or purpoſly on his privat judgment openly break the Churches Traditions and Ceremonies, which be not repugnant to holy Writ; but be ordained and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by common authority; ought to be rebuked openly, that others may fear to doo the like, as one that offendeth againſt the public Order of the Church, and woundeth the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of weak Brethren.

               <p n="6">The ſixth in a tru ſenſ is tru, That Beleevers, being reconciled to God by repentance, may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their preſent condition by a ful perſwaſion of Faith; yet muſt not preſume of infallible perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſith many Saints through frailty have faln dangerouſly.</p>

But what ſtrange ſtrife hath been about the principles of our Nature, and production of both Parts? For the corporeal, how doe Phiſitians and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers jar or jangle about the ſeed, whence it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? <hi>Archelaus</hi> aſſerts it a milky ſlime or mud drawn from the earth: A cold muddy conceipt. <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the ſcum or froth of our beſt blood: A frothy fancy. <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> part of the Brain: A brainleſs buz. <hi>Plato,</hi> a diſtilling marrow of the back bone. <hi>Democritus,</hi> a ſubſtance extracted from al members. <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Mans ſpirit and ſpoil of his Soul. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> a fragment both of Body and Soul. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> a portion of radical moiſture. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> an excrement of the laſt concoction in the ſolid parts. Others, blood refined by heat of the Genitals. Al which are lame, not expreſſing the efficient, matter, or form: For ſeed materially conſiſts both of Blood and Spirit, conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into a white frothy humor by the Teſticles (which Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males hav latent, tho not prominent) for the uſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; and from them (not of brain, back bone, or other part) ſoly derived: But whether females ſend or ſpend any operativ geniture, is much controverted. The <hi>Perepatetics</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: But <hi>Galeniſts</hi> conteſt, that no conception can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concurrence of both Parents ſeed, which is indubitably the trueſt Opinion.</p>
            <p>The ſpiritual part affords much more matter or fuel of altercation about the Soul: 1. What it is? <hi>Ariſtole</hi> refels diverſ Tenets; but his own deſcription halts at laſt: 'tis eaſy to ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what 'tis not; not what 'tis. It is no temper of elements, nor blood, nor energy of life, nor <hi>Galens</hi> Craſis: but in general, an eſſential quickning form, which givs Plants a life vegetant, Beaſts a ſentient compriſing the Former, and Men an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent including both; as a Pentagon contains a Tetragon, and that a Trigon. For Souls being Forms, and thoſ relativs, not ſubſiſting alone; but, as parts of compounds, are hatdly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined or diſquired.</p>
            <p>2. What manner of ſubſtance it is; whether corporal or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:168435:18"/> incorporeal? for God only is ſimply immaterial, and al things elſ, in ſom ſort corporal, tho not viſible; as neither is pure Air. Hence divers Divines aver Angels to be corporeal, becauſ finit and limited to place; being bounded, as it were, with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, that they cannot be ubiquitants every wher or elſwher at once: Much more then Mens Souls, which liv in Bodies. The Schools ſay a Body is in place circumſcriptivly, a Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitivly: be it ſo: but is not definit ſo to be here, as not to be elſwhere? Doo not Spirits aſcend, deſcend, and change place? Is not their motion made in time, tho very ſwift? Are not theſ acts proper paſſions of a Body, though impalpable, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, imperceptible? God then is a Spirit in creat, purely imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; Angels creat comparatly material; and ſo are Souls ſeparat, much more thoſ in Bodies. But what maner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whether aereal, etherial, or ſubtler ſublimer eſſence, none, ſave the Father of Spirits can define or determin.</p>
            <p>3. How it attains or acquires knowledg? Whether by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of what it knew before, as <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, ſuppoſing a precreation, which is improbable? Or by the ſenſes ſervice, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſerts, which is ignoble? Or by her own inbred ſeeds of underſtanding, which is moſt honourable? the ſenſes conduce much to manure the mind and improv ſcience; but our Soul of it ſelf apprehendeth, judgeth, retaineth, reaſoneth, reſolveth without inſtruction, though better or worſ, according to the various temper or ſymetry of the brain, hir chief organ: For 'tis abſurd that ſo divine an eſſence ſhould rely on vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſenſ, which only comprehends accidents (color, ſound, ſavor, odor) not the forms or nature of things, much leſs Natures ſecrets, or univerſal inſenſible objects. Nay if ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence com from ſenſe, then ſuch as hav ſharpeſt ſight, hearing, &amp;c. ſhould be wiſeſt or wittieſt, which oft befals contrary; and men born deaf, dumb, or blind, are of acuteſt entelechy: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that principle of <hi>Peripatum</hi> (Nothing is in the intellect, which was not firſt under ſenſ) can ſcarſ ſtand ſound: for though it be furthered by ſenſ, yet it depends not thereon; ſith the ſenſes are ſubordinat, and know nothing without it.</p>
            <p>4. How many Souls cohabit in one body, whether three or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but one? Som ſay three, whereof the Vegetativ and Senſitiv
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168435:18"/> dy with the body; but intellectiv livs eternaly. The moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox allow only one inveſted or indowed with the faculties forenamed, which dy not with the body tho their acts and operations ceaſ for want of fit organs: as the power of ſeeing remains when the eys ere dimmed or torn out. Nor doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of faculties and functions derogat from the Souls unity, more then different offices or operations in the Sun to ſoften, harden, melt, dry up, &amp;c. elſ ther muſt be many Souls in the Microcoſm, and Suns in the Macrocoſm: but as the Sun ſuffers no decay, when during an eclipſ it neither ſhines nor warms: ſo the Soul dies not nor her faculties, though after ſeparation ſhe uſeth no faculties being deſtitut of organs. <hi>Zanohy</hi> holds the Souls unity conſiſting of three eſſential parts; wherof the Vegetal being firſt infuſed, at coming of the Sentient periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (others of his opinion ſay vaniſheth or removeth) and that upon acceſs of the Rational, which is harſh doctrin to digeſt: For hereby a duple death muſt inſu by deſtruction or departure of thoſe two firſt Souls. Indeed they are diſtinct eſſences in Plants, Beaſts, and Men; but ſubordinat ſubſervient faculties to Mans Soul, and cannot ſubſiſt without it.</p>
            <p>5. Whence it coms, or how it enters this earthy manſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whether by infuſion or generation? which is the main <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſcope, or ſubject of this ſubſequent ſpeculation. For as ther be three productions of Man (beſide the common) foretouched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, Without natural Father and Mother, as <hi>Adam</hi> created by God. The ſecund, From a carnal Father without Mother, as <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> Rib. The third, Of a Mother without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Father, as Chriſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt. So are ſaid to be three ſeveral origins of Mans Soul. 1. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as <hi>Adams.</hi> 2. By transfuſion, as <hi>Eves.</hi> 3. By Traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or procreation, as al their Poſterities ſince; which is the debat here to be diſcuſſed, but hardly decided or defined.</p>
            <p>Divers diſſident opinions occur which ſhal be fully and fairly vented or ventilated, ſpecially the two principal of Creation and Traduction. They are reduced to three general heads: 1. The efficient, whence Souls com, whether of God, Angels, or Men? 2. The matter whereof, whether of ſomthing or nothing? 3. The time when, whether from eternity or eviternity?
<pb facs="tcp:168435:19"/> The particulars ſhal be handled promiſcuouſly.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> thought Mans Soul to proced <note place="margin">Opinions.</note> from the Worlds Soul of celical immortal ſubſtance; but crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in ſet number, not to be augmented or diminiſhed; which in du time deſcend to be united with bodies deſigned for them. Theſ, being ſeparat, paſs into other bodies, as the Jews deemed, or dreamed, when ſom ſaid Chriſt was <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or one of the Prophets, who were dead.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Origen,</hi> the father of fancies or fopperies, held, That God created al at once, keeping them in a Treaſury to be ſent into bodies prepared for them; becauſ he reſted from al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific Works the ſeventh day, and doth not ſtil form new Souls. His reaſon is better then his opinion.</p>

            <p>5. The Traductis are of two ſorts: Som hold the Soul is corporeal, and begot carnally, as the Body; whom ſaint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> juſtly condemns. 6. Others, that 'tis a Spirit ſpiritualy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from both Parents Souls, with the Seed, like light from light:</p>
            <p>7. So <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> and many Godly Biſhops defended, with moſt of the Weſtern Church, as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> teſtifies: whom ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry moderniſts (<hi>Hunnius, Magirus, Goclenius, Brightman, &amp;c.</hi>) folow.</p>
            <p>8. The Infuſiaſts alſo are bipartit; Som imagin them crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without (as <hi>Ariſtole</hi> intimats) and after inſtilled; which is generaly exploded. 9.

            <p>S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Eucherius</hi> hang <hi>in bivio</hi> between both, who neither deny lineal traduction from Parents Souls, becauſ al are tainted one from another; nor jugial creation <hi>de novo &amp; nihilo,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168435:19"/> becauſ univerſaly received; but conceiv it cannot be evidently evinced out of ſacred Scripture. Many of no mean mark in the <note place="margin">Traductiſts Tenets.</note> literary Republic aſſert, That the Soul is produced or procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Parents, by an Animific virtu conveied with the Seed imparted ſucceſſively from the firſt Soul; which had a power, property, or prerogativ given by Gods general bleſſing (<hi>be fruitful and multiply</hi>) to beget a ſpiritual and immortal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance like it ſelf, in a mortal material Body; but contamined with the ſtain of that ſin, which was contracted by our Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents primitiv diſobedience (in whom al Mankind offended, as the Root) againſt the Creators command and commination: ſo Traduction, if duly weighed, doth no way wound or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its immortality: For God who inſpired an immortal eſſence into a Casket of Clay, gav it a faculty or energy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like indued with the ſame immortal authoquality, no leſs inſeparable (though not eſſential) then Rationality or Riſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; according to the received Rule, <hi>Naturae ſequitur ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na quodque ſuae.</hi> This is the ground work, or chief Ancher-hold, wherto they ſtick like Limpets to a Rock. But on the other part, how that primeval pollution of our firſt Parents prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (which at once defiles both Body and Soul) linealy tranſcending through the loins of Mankind, ſhould infect a ſpiritual pure-made Soul (wherein no corporal thing can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs) unleſs it be derived from Parents polluted Souls, is a very hard Theory to conceiv or comprehend: Nor doo the many coyned curious diſtinctions of Schools ſatisfy the ſcruple, if ſtrictly ſcanned; though Cobweb-Lawns wil ſuffice to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialiſts. 'Tis a lepry inſeparably hereditary, which may be ſullied or ſlubbered over with palliativ ſalvs: But al the wiles or wavings of mens wits in the world, cannot cleerly cure it, if it be created pure; which traduction eaſily skinneth. The Souls immortality on one ſide, and original ſins traduction on the other, are two difficil tasks to reconcile; but neither repugning to evident Scripture, nor to any Article of Faith which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ſalvation. Indeed the firſt Council of <hi>Bracarum</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> cenſured Priſcillianiſts for holding with <hi>Origen,</hi> That al Souls were created together and ſinned in Heaven; but the Apollinarians, Tertullianiſts, or mere Traductiſts, never were

            <p>The Infuſiaſtiſts build on theſ foundations. 1. That our <note place="margin">Infuſiaſts Grounds.</note> Protoparents perſonal ſin becam natural or univerſal by deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the Root 2. That God in his prohibition and commination <hi>(Of the Tree of knowledg thou ſhalt not eat; for in the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dy the death)</hi> infolded an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Covenant for al his Poſterity to be liable therto, as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Children are tainted: Hereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As by one</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>antequam nati,</hi> forlorn before born. 3. The Soul ſinned in conſenting and luſting, the Body in taſting and eating: ſo both are guilty. 4. Neither Soul nor Body apart is the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quat ſubject of ſin, but both united, or the whol man: the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>ſubjectum a quo</hi> of derivation, the Soul <hi>in quo</hi> of inheſion, the whol <hi>de quo</hi> of predication; to whom al accidents of both parts are denominatly aſcribed. 5. It cannot properly be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſin, til the Souls infuſion, becauſ the Embryo is inanimat and imperfect; but the rational Soul muſt firſt animat, yet it can be ſtiled ſin. For whatever is not capable of Gods Image (as ſeed is not) is not liable to its privation; becauſ the habit and privation belong to the ſame ſubject. 6. The <hi>Principium a quo</hi> is derived by ſeed from Parents, begetting a depraved diſpoſition in Man, wherto a polluted womb ads more fuel; which by the Souls union breaks forth into a flame, and ſets the whol houſ on fire; both parts together corrupting and being corrupted by a kind of emanation. So before 'tis infuſed, we are ſaid to contract ſin from Parents, as Infants draw diſeaſes (Stone, Gowt, Lepry, &amp;c.) that is, the impreſſion or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only. 7. This ſin is no ſimple privation, as blindneſs which deprivs ſight for ever; but potential only, including a poſitiv propenſion therto. 8. Ther be three degrees of purity. 1. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolut of God. 2. Subordinat, according to the creatures ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, of Angels and Man in innocence. 3. Comparat, when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168435:20"/> being created pure, they decline from it: So our Souls being formed ſubordinatly pure, ſoon degenerat by natural concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; being, in reſpect of <hi>Adam</hi> and Angels, leſs pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ procliv to ſin. 9. The maner of imparting it from <hi>Adam</hi> to al Poſterity, is rather to be beleeved (ſaith Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi>) then inquired, and better inquired then explored; but eaſier explored then expreſſed: For its nature is moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, and the conveiance much more obſcure. 10. Parents Souls work to frame the whol compound Man, not by giving being to the new Soul, but by preparing a place to unite it with the Body: So they may be ſaid to concur in its production cuaſaly, by diſpoſing the Body to receiv it; not formaly by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating it, as <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> and his School Sectators de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine.</p>
            <p>Theſ are their curious Cautions, and beſt bulworks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ, yet al too little. To the Queſtion, Why God ſends a pure Soul into a polluted priſon? They ſay, becauſ ſhe hath a natural neceſſary pronenes therto, being ordained to unite with a Human Body, and both guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. For 'tis not created a ſimple Spirit to ſubſiſt by it ſelf, but in the Body with relation to it: which being derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> draws the guilt of his ſin by that preparation and union, without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal traduction; ſo ſhe becoms guilty both privativly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitivly; yet God no Author, Actor, nor Abettor therin. This ſin then folows creation by accident: for at <hi>Adams</hi> Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, was <hi>mens ſana in corpore ſano;</hi> but in every union ſince is ſin. So we muſt diſtinguiſh between Gods making and <hi>Adams</hi> marring: for he creats every Soul in ſubſtance ſound; but concupiſcence (which S. <hi>John</hi> ſais, <hi>is not of the Father</hi>) <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh. 2. 16.</hi>
               </note> creeps in inſtantly by Gods deſertion; ſith every Soul (even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis infuſed) is virtualy guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> fal, as he was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Fountain of al Mankind, both in morals and naturals; becauſ God covenanted either explicitly, as <hi>Cumel</hi> conteſts; or implicitly, as <hi>Sotus</hi> ſaith; that he ſhould ſtand or fal for himſelf and al his Of-ſpring, by his proper power of unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Free-wil.

Though he made al Decrees at once, in reſpect of himſelf; yet muſt they be effected or executed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſivly in reſpect of the things: as his decree to permit ſin, and deriv it by one to al Mankind; ſubſervs to the decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation. 4. When <hi>Adam</hi> received integrity, he had it as the root of al, whence his righteouſnes is ſtiled ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and we were created in him juſt after Gods Image. 5. His diſobedience and fal was ſemblably ours; becauſ the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (<hi>Thou ſhalt not eat</hi>) belongs to al in him the Stock-father. 6. His tranſgreſſion being the Head, is juſtly imputed to us, as Members, and the coruption of Nature or proclivity to evil inflicted as the penalty thereof. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims in the Antitheſis betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt: whoſ <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 15.</note> righteouſnes wherby we are juſtified, hath two parts. 1. The Grace or gift, which with remiſſion of ſins by his obedience is imputed ours. 2. Regeneration or Renovation of Nature as the effect. So original ſin is <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience imputed to us together with its guilt; and corruption of Nature not only a ſin, but a puniſhment on al, which ſinned by his fal. 7. When the Soul is ſaid to be ſtained by union with the Body; 'tis not meant properly by any Phyſical impreſſion: but ſo ſoon as both are united, a man is formed, to whom the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is inſtantly imputed; and by it a propenſion to al evil inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly folows, becauſ the Command and Commination was given to al Mankind in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That an Animific virtu is conveied with the Spirits of Parents ſeed, to beget or build up a Soul, as light diffuſeth light: That this Soul is the ſeat of ſin, being a ſpiritual vice of the Wil, as the Body is the ſubject of material accidents; but Man the denominativ or predicativ ſubject of both their qualities: That this ſin is propagated from our firſt Parents (by explicit or implicit Covenant) to al their Poſterity with the Soul, which is produced ſucceſſivly from Parents Souls, with the ſame ſtain of ſin.</p>
            <p>The Orthodox opinion is fixed on the foundations: That as God primarily inſpired <hi>Adams</hi> Soul, and afterward <hi>Eves;</hi> ſo he jugialy creats every Individual: That the new-made Soul inſtantly at infuſion (whether at conception or quickning) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the guilt of our Protoparents ſin; but the maner how, inſcrutable and inexplicable: That this generical ſin folows Soul-creating by accident, becauſ God gav <hi>Adam</hi> Free-wil, to ſtand or fal for himſelf and al his Of-ſpring; having predecreed to creat a number of Souls, to be infuſed into Bodies in du times: That though God be the Souls ſole Archiplaſt; yet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents properly beget <hi>totum Hominem (non totum Hominis)</hi> in regard of preparing the matter or manſion by the Formativ Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, whence the union neceſſarily inſues by divine decree.

For as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Works are his ordinary power, and miraculous extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: ſo Nature is his ordinary Voice, and divine Oracles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. What God ſpake in his Word, he hath wrought in the World, whoſ Words and Works agree: for ſecret things belong to him; but reveled to us and our Children. Wher he hath no toung to ſpeak, we may not hav an ear to hear, nor heart to inquire: but as Creatures we muſt ſubmit to our Creator, and as Chriſtians beleev wher reaſon cannot reach. Now to the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Rational Soul, whether produced immediatly from <note place="margin">Theſis.</note> God, or mediatly by Man, is of immortal Nature: yet ſtained with our firſt Parents firſt ſin, by propagation: but how can we know how 'tis made, before it be in being, ſith we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv what it is being made? For though we know 'tis a ſpiritual ſubſtance realy ſubſiſting in a Body; yet what maner of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical matter 'tis made of, none knows: No marvel then, if we be ignorant of the origin, which is harder to explore: For 'tis ſpiritual; and ſuch are difficiler to diſcern or diſquire then
<pb facs="tcp:168435:33"/> corporals, ſubject to ſenſ: ſpecialy ſith ours is an incomplet Spirit or part of a Creature; Man being compoſed of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body and immortal Soul: the one indued with ſenſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv al corporeal Images; the other furniſhed with a faculty of Reaſon, which from thoſ Images draws diſcurſes and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, wherby it gets knowledg of cauſes and effects, wherof Senſ is incapable. Hence it happens, that when we diſcurſ of ſpiritual Natures, which tranſcend Senſ, we are put out of our uſual way, and wander, as half loſt, in incertainty, without any exact knowledg to content the Mind. Whatever excellences be in inferior Natures, are much more perfectly in ſuperiors: as thoſ of other Animals more eminent in Man, chiefly in his Soul; thoſ of his Soul more conſpicuous in Angels; and al perfections of al moſt traſcendent in God. So the knowledg of inferior Natures, is comprehended in ſuperior; but not contrarily: Nor can any, ſav God (who hath no ſuperior) know it ſelf purely or properly, but only by reflexion; as the Ey, which ſees al things, cannot behold it ſelf, ſav in a Glaſs: Nor can we know our own Soul, but as 'tis ſhewed in a myrrhour of the Works: and as by it we know other things; ſo by them we hav a glimpſ of it.</p>
               <p>To omit ſeveral Opinions of Pagan Philoſophers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <note place="margin">Opinions.</note> Heretics: The orthodox jointly agree, that Mans Soul is either immediatly created by God, or mediatly generated by Man: both which are bipartit.</p>
               <p>In point of Creation, <hi>Hilary,</hi> with others, hold it to be formed without the Body, and then infuſed. But the general Tenet is, that 'tis created and infuſed in the Body, which runs moſt current.</p>
               <p>So for propagation: Som ſuppoſe it a corporeal ſubſtance, and begot in bodily maner; which is generaly exploded.

               <p>The caſe is very dubious and difficil: For how can Spiritual ſubſtances beget one another?

Now if we receiv the worſt part only from <hi>Adam,</hi> which is not the ſubject of ſin; ſith not the parts, but whol Perſon ſinned: How can a Man be guilty of ſin (if his Soul com immediatly from God) ſav only

One cannot be a proper Father of the whol, unleſs he beget both parts: for to ſupply meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is elementar) makes not a Father, ſith the Form only denominats; which if he doth not generat, he can no more be a Father then to Fleas and Lice, which are bred of his Body: Nay, if Fatherhood conſiſts chiefly in giving the Form, God is rather the tru Father, from whom the principal part proceds, then Parents which beget the baſer. The Soul is Mans eſſential part, without which he is no Man: How then can he procreat a Creature like himſelf, if he produce not the Soul? ſpecialy ſith al agree, that he propagats ſuch an accident as ſin, which inheres in the Soul as its ſole ſubject. Can he propagat an unnatural accident Sin, which cannot be without the Soul; and not a natural eſſence the Soul, without which can be no Sin? The faculty of propagation pertains to the Soul ſo wel as Body, yea hath its chif ſeat in the Soul ſoly; for the Body is as a Pen in the Writers hand, but the Soul principal Scribe or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary: ſith then ſuch as the cauſ is, ſuch is the effect; the Soul muſt produce a Soul, and whol Man a whol Man; not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form lump, which without a Soul is neither Man nor Beaſt: but the Soul ſtil accompanies the Seed at firſt conception, and gradualy builds the Body, fitly framing al the organs from the firſt rudiments to ful perfection: Nor can ſuch effects be doon <note place="margin">Exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His Grounds are theſ: 1. God created three ſorts of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">A new opinion</note> Natures. 1. Angels ſo ſublime, as they cannot join with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 2. Beaſts Souls ſo material, as they cannot be ſeparat from Bodies. 3. Mens Souls, in a mean, which can both liv without Bodies after death, like Angels, and unite with Bodies in this life like Beaſts Souls. So he ordained, That Angels ſhal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſ nor decreaſ: Senſitiv Souls both increaſ and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ: But Rational increaſ or multiply, not decreaſ or periſh.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168435:34"/> Hence he infers, that Angels are crated immediatly by God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Beaſts Souls procreated mediatly one from another: But Mens Souls partly produced by Gods immediat power, and partly by mediat propagation, or ſuch a production as coms neereſt to creation.</p>
               <p>2. Mans Soul is indued with power to uſe bodily organs in attaining knowledg of al ſenſible things: yea our knowledg of God ariſeth ordinarily from Senſ ordered by Reaſon; which is a mean between Beaſts ſenſ and Angels Intelligence. Therfore God united the Soul with a Body, which it naturaly deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incomplet without it, nor knows ought ordinarily but by it. As then al ordinary faculties and works are doon mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by corporal Natures; ſo is their origin or Of-ſpring, or elſ could not hav ſuch ſympathy with a Body. Yet as the Nature and Works therof are ſom way extraordinary, without &amp; abov al Elementar Natures: ſo God proportioaly hath a ſupernatural extraordinary work in producing it different from al others.</p>
               <p>3. Elementar Natures cannot be produced without a more excellent external efficient then themſelfs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical bodies, by their light, motion, and influence: for ſo al ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunars depend on them for being, beſide the matter wherof they are particularly compounded, and peculiar Forms: but the Soul having a Spiritual kind of compoſition, nobler then the reſt from Parents by ſeed, requires a ſpiritual extern efficient beſide it ſelf, which muſt needs be God the Father of Spirits; ſith Stars being bodies, cannot produce Mans Soul, to which they are far inferior.</p>
               <p>4. Human conception often fails, and is not ſo frequent as in other Creatures: which argues it is not of Nature alone, but by Gods more ſpecial power and providence, then in other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. If then he acts more in Mans conception, why ſhal not the Soul be produced then, without a duple task of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and infuſing at quickning?

               <pb facs="tcp:168435:35"/>
               <p>5. As God eternaly decreed of Man, both who ſhal com into the World, how many, and when: ſo he works in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception more then in al others; which muſt needs be as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat efficient of his Soul, wherby he bleſſeth or blaſteth concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ordering it by a ſpecial providence, according to his decree: contrarily, ſundry inconveniences ariſe from creation, that ſom Children are fully formed; which dying before the Soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, cannot com to Judgment, that God may be glorified; and ſo his work ſhal be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>6. 'Tis evident in promiſcuous copulations of Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Beaſts, that Gods efficient power is joined with the Souls propagation; ſith ſuch beſtial births are not indued with Reaſon, nor ſhal com to Judgment, though their ſenſitiv En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telechy is ſharper and ſubtler then other Animals; as Apes and Baboons are ſuppoſed to ſpring primitivly from ſuch unnatural mixtions or conjunctions. Nor is the Soul immediatly created by God ſans natural means, ſith Children begot in Inceſt or Adultery hav it; which God ſhal ſeem to approv or further, when he might hinder it, being not bound to infuſe Souls. This Reaſon may be retorted, ſith he is not bound to aſſiſt at ſuch coitions, being a moſt free Agent, and not a Natural: ſo he cannot be an external efficient, as the Sun is in other generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>7. Sith Nature by divine Ordinance, produceth daily out of dead Elementar matter admirable powers of Seing, Hearing, Phantaſy, Memory, belonging to brute Beaſts; the maner wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Reaſon cannot conceiv: how much more can the God of Nature produce out of Mans more excellent Nature others like to it, though we cannot comprehend the manner how? Nor is corporal Seed (which is of far purer temper and ſubtler Spirits then in other Animals) an unfit Inſtrument to propagat a Rational Soul; ſpecialy ſith the Spirits in Seed are of ſublime Nature, which hav neer affinity with the Soul.</p>
               <p>8. God hath ſet a natural order, That a whol Man ſhal beget the whol, both Body and Soul: yet not one the other, nor Soul a Soul alone, or Body a Body; but the Soul a Soul immediatly by the Body; and Body a Body by the Soul; but both jointly a whol Man: for they are Individualy united, and their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168435:35"/> concur: ſo Man propagats like other Animals, but by Gods immediat power in maner aforſaid.</p>
               <p>9. The Soul being not produced ſimply by Natures power, nor made of meer corporal matter, tranſcends the common condition of al corporeal Creatures, and is in it ſelf immortal, having God the extern efficient to produce it.</p>
               <p>10. The Soul being propagated from Parents, is polluted with Natures ſtain contracted from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; which is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Parents to Children, with the whol Man, as the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quat ſubject of it; yet God in no fault: ſith our Souls are not corrupted by him, but from our Parents and our ſelfs. If any cannot conceiv how one Soul produceth another (which is the hardeſt knot) let him conſider how it can be united to a Body and organized with it, which wil allay the difficulty: For if Angels hav aereal bodies (as many Antients deem) or at leaſt are not pure Spirits, compared to God; mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this Card our Author, ſailing betwixt <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> diſcovered <hi>Pachinus</hi> (a middle Promontory in <hi>Sicil,</hi> as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> did <hi>Cuba) viz.</hi> that as the Sun is external efficient in the general generation of al Sublunars, beſide their internal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular principles: ſo is God in the ſpecial production of every Mans Soul, beſide the peculiar Parents Souls working virtualy in the ſeed, as his pretended premiſſes prov:</p>
               <p>Which he farther confirms thus. 1. Ther is no diametral <note place="margin">Conformation.</note> difference between Soul and Body, but they may be naturaly coupled together: For though the Soul be not viſible; yet hath it a ſpiritual ſubſtance, not ſimply pure, but the loweſt degree of Spirits, prone to unite with corporeal natures, and ſo may be propagated with them, as united to them. 2. Every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the more excellent 'tis, hath a neerer union with the firſt Being, on which it depends, and is more immediatly moved by it: whence it folows, that the Soul being more excellent and neerer to God then any corporal Creature; in which he works
<pb facs="tcp:168435:36"/> more immediatly then others, after they are made: ſo he doth in the firſt production of it. 3. Nothing is generated but hath ſom extern efficient Cauſ, which in Coporeals is the Celical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: whence 'tis ſaid the Sun and Man be get a Man, as the Sun and Lion a Lion: But the Soul being a Spirit, and made at firſt by God, can hav no other extern efficient ſav the ſame immediat power: So it may more truly be ſaid, God and Man generat the Soul; God as efficient, and Parents as his procreant inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to produce what, how and when he pleaſeth, according to his eternal Decree: Nor is it abſurd, that Man hath two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern efficients; but rather an honor that God and Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to his generation. 4. Mortality proceds not from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, but divine malediction: for had not Man ſinned, his Body ſhould be eviternal ſo wel as Soul: <hi>Ergo</hi> if it were compounded and generated in a corporal way (which is not ſo) yet it folows not to make it mortal. 5. Whatever hath being immediatly from God, cannot be annihilated but by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat power, which is the tru cauſ of immortality. Hence the Body being produced ſoly by Natures power, doth dy or periſh; yet the Soul produced by immediat act of the Deity, can never dy but by the ſame power which gav it life.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that though the Soul be produced as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; yet is it immortal: ſith 'tis neither made of corporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor generated in meer natural maner: Nor is God faulty, though we be ſinful; ſith being wholy in <hi>Adam,</hi> and actualy one with him; our whol Nature is ſo defiled, and Gods pure ordinance in producing Souls depraved; that a total corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſſeth in the very conception, and we ſtained with original ſin at our very firſt being.</p>
               <p>To cleer the Caſe, he frames ſom objections againſt this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way. 1. Ob. <hi>If the Soul be reſolved into a firſt principle of</hi> Adams <hi>Soul, whence al are derived, as Mixtils are into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it muſt needs be mortal as al ſuch are:</hi> Ergo <hi>'tis not ſo derived, or elſ 'tis mortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The compariſon is unlike: for Mixtils are compact of Elements into which they reſolv; but Mens Souls not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>Adams</hi> (no nor Bodies) nor one of another; but of the ſame nature, and ſo ſimple as his. Nor doth it folow, if
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168435:36"/> the Soul be compounded like Elements, it muſt inevitably be mortal: for death and corruption coms not from compoſition or propagation, but meerly from malediction for ſin; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wherof is death.</p>
               <p>2. Ob. <hi>If God cooperats with Man in producing Souls, he no leſſ reſts from his works then in jugial creating them of nothing: for the thing is the ſame, and terms little differing:</hi> Ergo <hi>this novity of a middle way, to make God the external efficient, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vanity and of no validity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Here is no creation of nothing, but production of a thing from former principles: Nor doth it repugn Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie reſt, to concur in other works of providence, government, and the Souls ſpiritual acts; nor in aſſiſting its production as an extern efficient, which tends only to preſerv Mankind; ſpecialy ſith it hath no mediat maner in ordinary courſ of nature, ſav on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods immediat concurrence in extraordinary maner.</p>
               <p>3. Ob. <hi>If Man cannot generat his like without Gods ſpecial extraordinary help; he is in this behalf inferior to Beaſts, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiſts urge against Creation:</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Not ſo: for Beaſts beget alſo by the Heavens help, as exterior efficients: If then Mans Soul for excellence hath a far ſublimer ſupercelical efficient: And he acts ſo much in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his like, as other Creatures doo in theirs; 'tis rather a dignity abov al, then any diſparagement at al. So this exception holds againſt jugial creation, wherin Man no whit concurs, which may ſeem a derogation: but not againſt natural propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>4. Ob. <hi>If God be immediat extern efficient of our ſin-polluted Souls by natural propagation; he is Author or acceſſary to ſin, rather then by creation:</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Nothing leſſ: for he is only external efficient of the Soul, not of ſin; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> coms from corrupt Parents, who ſupply the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matter of the whol Man, wherin ſin conſiſts, ſith generation is not of Parts, but Perſons; it being his juſt ordinance in nature, That as the Tree is, ſo ſhal the fruit be. Sith then he made Man perfectly good at firſt, to beget Children perfect like himſelf; who prevaricated and polluted al his Progeny or Poſterity: God performs his part ſtil to confer his efficient power in the
<pb facs="tcp:168435:37"/> perpetual production of Mankind: And as he firſt infuſed his Soul, ſo he ſtil concurs in producing it, though not in the ſame ſort: yet ſin is meerly accidental in reſpect of him, who is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Author nor acceſſary: but 'tis propagated in generation by the firſt Mans fal or fault, through the loins of perpetual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity one from another.</p>
               <p>It reſts to preſent ſom gleanings, gathered from the ſaid <note place="margin">Corollary.</note> Treatiſ, which tends to this Theory. 1. Creation is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical production of a Thing out of Nothing immediatly by God: ſo the firſt Chaos (caled Heaven and Earth) was made of meer nothing, and the reſt mediatly out of it: but <hi>Adams</hi> Body of Earth mediatly, and his Soul immediatly of nothing, by a middle way of Production.</p>
               <p>2. Propagation is a Natural act or faculty, wherby a living Creature begets his like, for continuance of the Kind: this is the proper perfection of every Animal (Vegetant, Sentient, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent) being the moſt excellent faculty ingrafted in Nature by Gods ſpecial charge and bleſſing of <hi>Increaſ and multiply;</hi> which is duple. 1. Equivocal, when Plants or Animals are bred of putrefaction; as Weeds, Magots, Eeles, &amp;c. 2. Univocal, when ech Animat brings its like; as Wheat Wheat, Whale a Whale, Eagle an Eagle, Lion a Lion, Man a Man.</p>
               <p>This is doon by the ſeed of generation, which contains the whol Nature to continu the Species for ever; wheras Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are al mortal or momentany. So Mans ſeed, Natures quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence containing the whol Kind, is lodged in a place fit for propagation of another conſpecifical: which generation being Mans perfection; he cannot be ſaid propagat either part, but the whol, or a third conſiſting both of Form and Matter. Hence our propagation from <hi>Adam,</hi> is a deduction of the whol Man, according to Natures courſ, in turning our potential be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into act, which derivs his Nature to us: but if the Soul be fetch'd from Heaven, and Body from Earth; how ſhal both ends be brought together; or what ſhal this mix'd action be caled? Simple Creation it cannot be, nor pure propagation; but a Mungrel like a Mule. For Creation and Propagation dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diveſly. 1. One is Gods work by himſelf, of meer nothing; wrought by his ſole Word and Wil: the other Natures of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168435:37"/> ſom preexiſtent matter according to ech Creatures kind, by Gods ordinance ſetled in Nature. 2. That is doon in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant by an infinit eſſence which requires no time; this by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious preparations or gradual perfections which take time, tho the very conception is acted in a moment. 3. One is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any motion or mutation; but in the other the ſame matter is changed or varied into ſeveral forms. 4. In the firſt, things are not made of one ſubſtance with the Creator; but in the laſt, both hav the ſame ſubſtance. 5. In Creation privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preceds the habit, power act, and darknes light: but in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation contrary, habit foregoes privation (as ſight blindnes) act power, and light darknes.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons that Mans Soul cannot be propagated by courſ of Creation are theſ. 1. It impugns Gods Juſtice, to put a <note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note> pure innocent eſſence into a condition to be inſtantly damned for anothers ſin; which it muſt be, if an Embryo dies before born and baptiſed. To this 'tis ſaid the new Soul is guilty by union; which is a greater aſperſion on divine Juſtice, but no <hi>ſalvo:</hi> for if it be in no fault, why ſhal it be guilty and puniſhed for <hi>Adams</hi> fal? If it be replied, That God ſo eternaly Decreed; this farther aggravats: nor doth it appear that he ſo Decreed; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to aver without warrant, is moſt hainous: for if he Decreed (as Supralapſarians harſhly hold) that al ſhould ſin and ſuffer death in <hi>Adam,</hi> 'tis requiſit to be by juſt means: which if it may be doon by Traduction rather then Creation; yea by that way and not this; then is that to be counted Gods Decree. Can Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſelf deal unjuſtly? ſurely in equity is no iniquity. God promiſeth and proclameth, that a faultleſſ Child ſhal not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note> for his Fathers guilt: why then ſhal a good Soul be ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed for anothers ſin, to whom it is ſcarſ kin? ſith <hi>Adam</hi> that ſinned was no ſimple Soul, but a Man.</p>
               <p>2. If the Soul be immediatly created pure, it cannot be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by a Body, which of it ſelf is not the ſubject of ſin, nor can defile a ſpiritual ſubſtance, being the firſt mover of al acts in the Body; and it ſhould rather ſanctify that, then be ſtained by it. So it may better be defended, that we hav original righteouſnes, becauſ the Soul coms from God; then original ſin, becauſ the Body coms from <hi>Adam.</hi> If it ſhould be granted, that the Soul
<pb facs="tcp:168435:38"/> is polluted by yeelding to bodily luſts; yet this is actual ſin, not original corruption: Nor can it com from a pure created Soul. To this 'tis ſaid, That at the inſtant of Creation, God bereavs al ſupernatural gifts for <hi>Adams</hi> lapſ, which though it put not evil into the Soul; yet original ſin neceſſarily flows or folows. This ſeems uncouth, that God ſhal at once doo and undoo, or make and mar ſo ſoon as 'tis made; or giv goodneſs and take it away inſtantly. Nay if it be created in infuſing, 'tis void of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural gifts, and ſo cannot be deprived of what it never had. But if it be created without thoſ gifts which to us are ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, he creats it evil; as al Men are without ſuch; nor can a Soul be good without them. If then God makes it ſo that it muſt needs be evil, he makes it evil; ſith he makes it that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good: Yet if al the premiſſes be conceded, 'tis never the neer to ſalv original ſin; ſith this is not to ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> but to becom ſinful for him: So it reſults, that the Soul if created good, cannot poſſibly contract <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: nor can al Mens wits or wiles cleerly ſhew, how a Soul created pure can be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted; and al ſhifts hitherto deviſed, are ſilly Cobweb Lawns, pervious to every ey. The laſt refuge (that it coms neither by Soul nor Body, but by union of both; ſith by it we becom Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo his ſin made ours) is Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, but ſcarſ ſatisfactory: For it is a ſpiritual Lepry which hereditarily infects the whol Man, with al parts and powers. If then the Soul at firſt union be pure and Body polluted, the Child ſhal be half holy and half ſinful: Or if both be clean at firſt, how can union make both or either unclean? for when two good are conjoined, both becom better. Hence ſom ſay <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is only imputed, not inherent; and ſo we only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted corrupt. Indeed Chriſts righteouſnes is realy ours by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and a voluntary inſtitution, as a Covenant of Grace differs from ordinary Juſtice in courſ of Nature; ſith 'tis free to ſhew mercy without cauſ, but not to puniſh without du de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert: Nor can this ſin be juſtly imputed to al, unles the whol Man be propagated; for 'tis a real infection of the whol Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>3. As by Gods Ordinance original ſin paſſeth from one to al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Mankind; ſo by propagation al Mankind proceds out of one:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168435:38"/> and as that ſin overſpreads the whol Man; ſo both parts being infected muſt needs be propagated. Again as this ſin is ſeated ſpecialy in the Soul; ſo 'tis chiefly propagated according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures courſ. Hence three points reſt to be proved. 1. That original ſin paſſeth only by propagation, as Scriptures univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly teſtify. By one man death paſſed upon al, becauſ al ſinned in him: and 'tis imputed to his Poſterity, becauſ al were in him as the Root or Stock, and al deſcend out of him; ſo his ſin becoms ours both by imputation and propagation; but by the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ of the laſt: For 'tis not anothers ſin imputed, which is not ours, but that made ours by propagation actualy, which before was only potentialy. This is cleer by the Antitheſis between the firſt and ſecund <hi>Adam;</hi> as in one al dy, ſo in Chriſt ſhal al be made aliv: The one being Root of Mankind, in whom al are by Nature; the other Head of the Elect, in whom they are al by Grace. Such then are deceived, as deem <hi>Adams</hi> ſin only imputed, like Chriſts righteouſnes; ſith this laſt is the Creators voluntary Inſtitution and work of meer Mercy; but the firſt a neceſſary operation of the Creature and work of Juſtice. So the Antitheſis holds tru thus: As in Chriſt we fulfilled the Law, ſuffered death and attained ſalvation, being members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by Grace: So in <hi>Adam</hi> we eat the forbiden fruit, becam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans bondſlaves, and were in ſtate of damnation, being al mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Body by Nature. So Chriſt derivs his righteouſnes to his Children by ſpiritual regeneration, as <hi>Adam</hi> did his ſin to al Men by natural generation: <hi>Ergo</hi> as Chriſts righteouſnes is not imputed but by means of regeneration, wherby we becom members of his Body: So <hi>Adams</hi> ſin cannot be imputed but by generation, wherby we deſcend from him as his members. If <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be ſimply imputed, becauſ we are Men as he was, who received or loſt for himſelf and al Mankind; then muſt it be imputed to Chriſt as Man, ſo wel as to us; which is not ſo: for our ſinning in him, and being ſinfully propagated from him, makes us liable; which Chriſt was not, becauſ ſanctified in the womb, by the holy Ghoſt, at firſt conception: but al elſ derived from him, and his ſin to us through one anothers loins. 2. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin cannot be propagated, unles the whol Man and both Parts be; which neceſſarily flows from the premiſſes: for except
<pb facs="tcp:168435:39"/> the whol Man deſcends from him, the whol cannot be infected; ſith neither Soul nor Body alone is the ſubject of ſin, but the Perſon. Or if the whol be not the ſubject, 'tis not properly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Law likewiſe is given to the whol, and the Perſon puniſhed or rewarded. 3. The whol Man cannot be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, unles the Soul be; ſith the whol conſiſts of its parts. To ſay the Soul coms from <hi>Adam quoad exiſtentiam &amp; unionem, non quoad eſſentiam,</hi> is ſly Sophiſtry, not real or rational: for then Man contributs but the worſt part, not the whol nor half: Nor is it tru, that <hi>Adam</hi> is cauſ of the union; but rather God, if he creats the Soul. Nor if the Soul be infuſed, can any tel how long time after conception; during which ſpace the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man works alone. But if the whol Man be ſaid properly to proced from <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſ the body doth; much more may it be verified to com from God, becauſ the Soul doth: ſo the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather to be aſcribed to God, as the nobleſt ſuprem Agent, then to Man the baſer and inferior. If then the whol Man and both parts be not propagated, it reſults that we were in <hi>Adam</hi> wherin we are not, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perſon: that we ſinned in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, without which he could not ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul: That the whol Man was in <hi>Adam</hi> yet never cam from him: That we loſt in him which we never had of him, <hi>viz.</hi> original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: That he ſhal ſtil be ful of Souls which he never had: That the whol perſon proceds from him, yet not that which makes the whol.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſts Soul was not created; but his whol Humanity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> taken from the Virgin: for his birth, life, death are curioſly and circumſtantialy recorded by the Evangeliſts; but no Soul crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which they would not omit being ſo pregnant a proof that he was without ſin, if it was created pure: Nor is any Souls creation, ſince <hi>Adams</hi> ſpecified in Scripture. Chriſt is caled <hi>the ſeed of the Woman,</hi> and <hi>Davids ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the fleſh:</hi> which imports the whol Humanity, as oppoſed to his Deity. but if his Soul was created, the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to al Men, muſt be likewiſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able to him as Man. Ad hereto, That the Soul and Body (as 'tis in al others) were conceived at once: for the divine Nature being immediatly united to the Soul, and by it to the Body; the Soul muſt be produced in the moment
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168435:39"/> of conception with the Body; or elſ the Deity was firſt united to a brute Body, which is brutiſh to imagin. The truth is, his Soul being united with the Body into one Nature at firſt concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becam one Perſon with the eternal Word, by a miraculous working of the holy Ghoſt, who purified the Womb, that the Birth becam exempt from ſin. So his whol Humanity (Soul and Body) was deduced from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſeparated from the Virgin by the holy Ghoſt: But a Soul cannot be produced by Natures ordinary courſ (no more then a Body) without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both Sexes Souls: yet being performed by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power; 'tis a tru Soul, and ſo is the Body; both which joined in one Perſon make a perfect Man; as <hi>Eve</hi> was a very Woman, though taken out of Man; and Chriſt tru Man, taken only out of Woman. For in Mans quadruple production, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a duple concordance: <hi>Adam</hi> made immediatly by God, without Man or Woman: <hi>Eve</hi> mediatly out of Man, without Woman: Chriſt immediatly out of Woman, without Man: but al elſ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by both. 'Tis ſaid the holy Ghoſt ſanctified part of the Virgins ſubſtance, aſſumed by the Godhead, to make Chriſts Perſon: which terms are tru, if wel underſtood: For by part of hir ſubſtance is meant, the whol Nature, or both parts, (not Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy only) whereof his Humanity was framed. By ſanctifying is not meant clenſing that portion from ſin; but conſecrating it to that holy purpoſ, indowing it with gifts fit for ſo divine union: yet was it free from ſin, or rather never ſinful, by reaſon of this union. For al ſubſtances were created exceeding good, and depend immediatly on God: Nor is ſin eſſential to Mans Nature, but accidental, cleaving to the perſon by <hi>Adams</hi> fal; and not properly in the ſubſtance of Human Nature. Nor are evil actions or affections ſtiled ſimply ſinful; but the Man: ſith ſin conſiſts not in any pravity of matter; but in the corrupt Wil or intent of the dooer: Nor is ther any Law to puniſh parts or ſubſtances, but perſons or malefactors. So 'tis cleer that Chriſts ſubſtance, or whol Humanity, taken from the Virgin in ſuch miraculous metaphyſical maner, was not ſtained with ſin, becauſ not propagat by ordinary generation: For if it had bin ſinful, it could never be clenſed, nor any Man ſaved: ſith ther is one only Mediator, whoſ blood clenſeth us from al ſin; which
<pb facs="tcp:168435:40"/> the holy Ghoſts ſanctifying cannot doo, without virtu and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his redemption. If then his ſubſtance never was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the holy Ghoſt did nor clenſ it from ſin; but only ſeparat what in it ſelf was ſinleſſ, from a ſinful Perſon, that it might unite and ſubſiſt with a divine Perſon: For his Soul and Body, though derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> like others, could not be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſ he was conceived extraordinarily without Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, by ſevering ſom of the Virgins ſinleſſ ſubſtance from hir ſinful perſon, and uniting it to Gods perſon. Lo here a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of this ſublime myſtery; but a Labyrinth which he traceth forth and back, to ſhew that Chriſts Humanity, being taken from ſinleſſ ſubſtance, could not be ſinful.</p>
               <p>Thus three diſſident Opinions hav bin alterutratly agitated. <note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> 1. For the Souls jugial creation, which is moſt general. 2. For natural propagation from Parents Souls, as Lamps deriv light one from another, which ſeems more rational. 3. for a mix'd production, betwixt both, which is meerly Mathematical. 'Tis a witty novity, or caſtle in the air; yet likely to take better with moſt Men then old received Tenets; being haply borowed from Dr. <hi>Goodmans</hi> crotchet, but much changed: howbeit if both deny the Souls creation, ther is no neceſſity to make God an extern efficient in its production; ſpecialy ſith al inconveniences may be ſalved by ſimple Traduction, ſo wel as any other way. Nor is ther any warrant, that God concurs in extraordinary maner to propagat Mankind, more then any other Creatures; but leavs al indifferently to Natures courſ, firſt inſtituted by him, with a general benediction to increaſ, multiply, and propagat their ſeveral Kinds. Indeed his diſpoſing providence is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſuprem efficient of al things, that a Sparow cannot fal to ground without it: but that he is ſpecial Agent in Mans gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, more then other Creatures (as the Infuſiaſts and Mr. <hi>Woolnot</hi> conteſt) hath no grounds. God is ſaid to keep the keys of the womb, which he opens and ſhuts at free pleaſure: So he keeps the keys of the Clouds and al other works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But to make him a particular efficient with Man in the Souls production (as the Sun and celical bodies are ſuperior ſubordinats in other generations) is aſſerted <hi>gratis,</hi> without grounds; nor wil <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> ſerv to induce a credulity for ſuch a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168435:40"/> novity. He tartly taxeth the Infuſiaſts, for aſſerting God to creat new Souls, and aſcribing it to his eternal Decree, without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his Word; yet he doth the ſame, having no author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, as they hav. God created al things with a Word, which was no weary work; and could make millions of Worlds (as he did myriads of Angels) in a moment: but his Wil was to proced gradualy, taking ſix daies time to accompliſh one: which having ended, he reſted on the ſeventh from al ſuch works (wherof creating of Mans Soul was one) for ever, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or ſet it a part for a Sabbath, in memory of his reſt; enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it afterwards by a Law to be obſerved by Man for ever. If then he creats Souls continualy, how doth he reſt from al ſuch Works? Or how can it be ſaid, that hw wil at laſt Judgment creat new material Heavens and Earth, when the old ſhal be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied? Or laſtly, that he ſtil aſſiſts Man as an extern efficient in every Soul production, which emulats creation? If any wil ſeek the premiſſes of this Poſtſcript in Mr. <hi>Woolnots</hi> ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ, he ſhal ſo ſoon find a needle in a Bottle of Hay: ſo various are our garbs both for ſtile, ſtructure, method, and matter, one from another; as wil appear in al the reſt of the Theſes.</p>

            <head>Pura Dei Praedeſtinatio. <hi>Divine Predeſtination.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis is a profound point and very ponderous: for better cleering wherof, certain previous Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhal lay a foundation.</p>
            <p>1. Providence is Gods general Government of al <note place="margin">1. Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Things: Predeſtination his ſpecial care over free Intelligent Creatures, Angels and Men. Of it are two parts or branches: <hi>viz.</hi> Election to Life or Salvation; and Reprobation to Death or Damnation. Election (as our Churches ſeventeenth Article defines) is Gods chuſing of ſom in Chriſt out of Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Worlds foundation; and his everlaſting purpoſ ſecret to us, to deliver them from Curſ and Damnation, and bring them as Veſſels of honor to eternal Salvation, by the ſame Chriſt in whom they are choſen. So Reprobation muſt be his ſecret wil <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> not to deliver from Curſ and Damnation thoſ whom he hath not found in Chriſt; but to paſſ them by and caſt into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire, as Veſſels of diſhonor. Now this Theorem or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ concerns the maner and means of Gods proceding in both; which muſt be the Baſis of this great ſtupendious ſtructure to be raiſed or framed.</p>
            <p>2. Gods Attributs or expreſſions of his Eſſence (Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Omniſcience, Infinity, Eternity, Ubiquity, Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, Underſtanding, Wiſdom, Wil, Goodnes, Lov, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Juſtice, Truth, Patience, Holines, Bleſſednes, Majeſty, &amp;c.) muſt be conſidered as conſpiring in one, without confuſion or contradiction; ſpecialy thoſ that moſt concern this ſubject, which folow to be more preciſely and particularly agitated.</p>
            <p>3. Omniſcience or Preſcience is two-fold, as Schools define. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 1. Of pure ſimple Intelligence, wherby God knows al things
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168435:41"/> paſt, preſent, to com (neceſſary or contingent) and what might <note place="margin">Nota bone.</note> hav bin, if he had pleaſed to giv them being: yea the very events of al that ſhal be doon by himſelf or any Creature from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eternity. This the higheſt pitch of knowledg in an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Nature to work with Wiſdom, and therfore worthy of the wiſeſt Agent; ſpecialy in the firſt contriving and ordering of al things concerning contingent events of free Creatures. Hereby he foreknew <hi>Adams</hi> fal, before he decreed to creat or permit him to fal: or to ſend his Son for a ranſom, if he ſhould fal; upon which he contrived the whol work of Mans Redemption. This pure preſcience being previous to Predeſtination in order of Nature (according to our weak apprehenſion) yet al coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to God; did not look to the maſſ of Mankind as to be created incorrupt, nor as lapſed in <hi>Adam;</hi> Nor to Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or not beleeved on: but beyond al to the firſt, middle, and final eſtate of ech particular perſon, and univerſal of al Men. 2. Of Viſion, which is of things to be doon in time, with al acts and events therof, which depend on his free Wil and Pleaſure. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks of both: God knows al things which neither are, were, or ever ſhal be by his ſimple underſtanding: but the reſt that hav bin, are, or ſhal be, after what ſort ſoever, by the ſcience of Viſion. This diſtinction <hi>Zanchy, Junius,</hi> and other learned Reformiſts approv to be authentic in the very terms.</p>
            <p>4. Gods power or Omnipotence (who can doo what he wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which agrees to his Nature) is duple. 1. Abſolut, wherby he can do al that he wil, and more then he wils. 2. Actual, by which he doth what ever he wil, and hinders what he wil not hav doon in Heaven and Earth, with al things therin; whoſ Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ruleth and reigneth over al Creatures viſible or inviſible; nor could ever any reſiſt his power, or defeat his providence.</p>
            <p>5. Gods Wil (which comprehends his Lov, Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Truth, Juſtice, Wrath, Patience, Holines, &amp;c.) firſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf, as chief Soveraign good, and in himſelf al other good things freely, which are out of himſelf. Hereby he decrees (for Decree is no Attribut, but an Act of his Wil joined with power and preſcience) what of thoſ infinit things preſented by his underſtanding ſhal com into being. For Knowledg is his
<pb facs="tcp:168435:42"/> Counſilor, but Wil King, and both himſelf; <hi>who works al ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to the Counſil of his Wil,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. By it he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders al things cauſing or allowing what ſhal be, in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18, 19.</note> and to what end. Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes al to it, as ſuprem univerſal cauſ, into which al inferior are reſolved, as the prime ſpring. This is abſolut and independent: for til God paſſed his Decrees, al things were known but as poſſible, if he would giv being or not. Ther be other diſtinctions of divine Wil, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeveral objects, as that of Sign and good pleaſure uſed in Schools: but to giv God a duple different Wil in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (ſecret and reveled) as if he willed openly in his word to ſav al; yet decrees to reprobat moſt part in his hidden Counſils, is moſt abhorrent: For he is a God of Truth, no Lier, Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler or Mocker, uſing ſimplicity and ſincerity in al his ſayings, which are yea and Amen: Nor wil he make general promiſes in his Goſpel to al Beleevers, yet bar them by a cloſ clandeſtine decree of his ſecret Wil, that they ſhal not beleev: but it hath diverſ objects, or one placed in diverſ times: as 'tis his reveled Wil ther ſhal be a day of Judgment, yet he concels the time. So the Goſpel of Salvation was his ſecret Counſil before the World began; but ſince opened to the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c. which can no more be caled his hidden Wil. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis ſaid, <hi>Secret things belong to God, but the reveled to us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> 
               <hi>and our Children;</hi> which provs a diverſity of objects, but no duplicity of Wils; warning us only to attend what is reveled in his Word (as his general promiſes preſcribed) and not pry into his privy purpoſes, to inquire who are elect or who reprobats, leſt, like <hi>Thales,</hi> in gazing at the Stars, we fal into the Pit: for this is a perilous precipice of carnal preſumption.</p>
            <p>6. The Goſpel is a manifeſtation of Mans Redemption by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Jeſus Chriſt; which God firſt reveled in Paradiſe, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed ſhal break the Serpents head: Next to <hi>Abram</hi> at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> that in his ſeed al families and Nations ſhal be bleſſed: Then to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Wildernes, when God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Paſſover and ſeveral Sacrifices as Types or Figures of the holy Lamb, ſlain before the World for the Worlds ſins: Afterward to the Prophets: And laſtly to the Evangeliſts, who wrot our Saviours whol life &amp; death, after his Incarnation or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peerance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168435:42"/> in the fleſh, which is the myſtery of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>7. Goſpel Grace is Gods free Mercy offered to al lapſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Mankind: whoever wil beleev in his Son, repent their ſins, and perſever to the end, ſhal be ſaved. Which promiſſ muſt be preached and publiſhed to al ſorts, ſans reſpect of Perſons; as he is no reſpecter, nor delights in the death of a ſinner: For Man hath ſom liberty of Free-wil ſtil left (if revived or quickned by Grace) to obey or reſiſt, receiv or reject the motions of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>8. Gods Decree is duple. 1. Primary, Proceeding from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Omnipotence; wherby he eternaly willed to creat the World in du time, and to giv Man, made after his Image, abſolut Free-wil, <note place="margin">Decretum; 1 Abſolutum. 2 Condition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> without reſtraint any way. 2. Secundary, Depending on his Omniſcience; wherby foreſeing <hi>Adams</hi> fal (as he did the evil Angels Rebellion) he in meer Mercy ordained a remedy, to ſend his only begotten Son to be a Sacrifice for al: but with condition of beleef in him, and tru repentance for ſin; both which are equaly eternal, flowing from the Fountain of the Deity, who willeth what he wil, and doth what he willeth. Hence proceds Predeſtination, which is his ſecundary conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Decree, depending on Preſcience: wherby he freely elects ſom to lif, being al liable to death in <hi>Adam;</hi> and rejects or paſſes by the reſt to periſh in their diſobedience.</p>
            <p>9. Sin is of two ſorts. 1. Original (ſo caled by S. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> contracted from our firſt Parents. 2. Actual committed by al particular perſons. The remedy of one is Baptiſm into Chriſts faith; either by perſonal confeſſion, as in thoſe of tipe age; or by their Sureties ſponſion, as in Infants. The other is cured or clenſed by repentance, through the merits of Chriſts death; whoſ blood, by tru faith in him, purgeth from al ſin.</p>
            <p>10. God eternaly Decreed to creat al things in time, indued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with ſeveral Natures, and to make Man a free Intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like Angels; who gav one only prohibitiv precept upon pain of death; which foreſeing in his pure preſcience, he would violat or prevaricat, both to his own and Poſterities perdition, if juſtice be executed, as it muſt neceſſarily be by a juſt God: He by his knowledg of Viſion decreed ſecundarily, in meer Mercy, to ſend his Son, to ſalv al that ſhal believ in him, and uſe ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:168435:43"/> means of faith, repentance, and obedience, as are preſcribed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>11. God commands no more of Man, then he givs power or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> ability to perform; as <hi>Adam</hi> had by Nature, and al others by Grace: if then he requires ſince Mans fal faith, repentance, obedience, and perſeverance to work out our ſalvation by his Grace; certes he givs ability to beleev, repent, obey, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever by cooperating with it; but doth not croſſ-bar it by any contrary decree, which were meer mockery far from Mercy: for if one ly on the ground bound hand &amp; foot, 'tis mockery to bid him riſe or run away; but mercy to looſe or let him go: The Caſe is quadratly ſemblable and aptly applicable. Our good God is no mocker, but al Mercy; nor reſpecter of perſons, but receivs al that cal on him.</p>
            <p>12. God delights not in the death of a ſinner, but would hav <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> al to be ſaved: he hath ſpoken it who wil not beleev him, ſo wel as beleev in him? But if he hath abſolutly and peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed (from which is no appeal nor repeal) that Man ſhal ſin and conſequently dy; he delights in his death, and wil hav but a few ſaved. Hath he made him according to his own Image pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſly to make him the wrechedeſt of al Creatures? Surely his Wil and Decree is to reward every Man according to his works.

            <p>He reckons fiv diſſident Opinions touching the order of <note place="margin">1 Opinon.</note> Predeſtination. 1. <hi>Calvin, Beza, Piſcator, Whitaker, Perkins, &amp;c.</hi> hold, that God eternaly Decreed to creat a ſet number of Men, wherof he elected ſom to everlaſting life, and reprobated the reſt to eternal death of his free wil &amp; pleaſure; only to ſhew his Grace, Goodnes, or Mercy on the one; and his Juſtice, Power, or Dominion on the other. To which end he Decreed ſin ſhould enter on al, that he might juſtly puniſh moſt part for ſin; and to ſend his Son for redemption of the Elect in Mercy by free Grace.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:168435:43"/>
            <p>This peremptory poſition, is generaly condemned by Papiſts, <note place="margin">Refutation.</note> Lutherans, Arminians, and diverſ Reformed Divines, as peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and erroneus; becauſ it makes God the prime Author of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rejecting Men before they were evil by an antecedent abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut Decree, without reſpect to <hi>Adams</hi> future fal, but elects ſom before they are conſidered as ſinners, ſans reſpect to the ones faith or the others failing; as if preſcience had no place in Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</p>
            <p>2. The Synod of <hi>Dort, Peter Moulin,</hi> and many Engliſh <note place="margin">2 Opin.</note> Theologiſts defend, That God eternaly decreed to make Man holy and good; giving him perfect Free-wil: but foreſeing he would by Satans tentation fal into ſin, if he hindred it not; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to permit it, and out of this loſt lapſed lump, choſ a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number to ſalvation, ſuffering the reſt to periſh in ſin, whom he paſſeth by of free pleaſure, but puniſheth for juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits. Yet decreed to ſend his Son to redeem or ſav the elect, and his Spirit to cal or ſanctify them, that they may be glorified. The firſt ſort are ſtiled Supralapſarians, having no reſpect to <hi>Adams</hi> fal, decreed to ſend his Son: ſo they grant preſcience in order to preced Decree. This opinion freeth Gods juſtice on Infants dying unbaptiſed (which the firſt doth not) who hav no other deſert of death but original ſin.</p>
            <p>This Tenet is ſcarce veritable or warrantable, which <note place="margin">Refut.</note> to defend divine juſtice, ſuppoſeth mankind corrupted, before any Decree of election paſſed; which ſeems needleſſ: becauſ ther be good and bad Angels without any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or fal, and Chriſt was not in the lapſed lump, yet as man elected to life. It alſo ſuppoſeth Original ſin to be cauſ of Reprobation, which is remitted to many Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats condemned for actual ſins, as Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, it likewiſe teacheth, that Chriſt is ſent to ſav the elect only, as dying for them alone; who are to be caled by the Word and Spirit: but Reprobats being outwardly caled (who are barred from obeying) are more deeply condemned for refuſing it; yet hav no power to embrace it, which is harſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</p>
            <p>3. Doctor <hi>Overald</hi> a late learned Bisſhop, coined a new <note place="margin">3 Opin.</note> Tenet, That God decreed to creat man good, but foreſeeing
<pb facs="tcp:168435:44"/> his fal, appointed his Son to dy for al, and to cal men by his Word, offering Salvation to al: with common ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ient Grace to work Faith by the ordinary means, if they be not wanting to themſelves: but knowing our infirmity that none would beleev by the common Grace; decreed to ad a more ſpecial effectual to whom he pleaſed, being choſen according to his purpoſ: wherby they ſhal not only be able, but actualy and neceſſarily beleev, being drawn by the Father irreſiſtibly.</p>
            <p>This is plauſible, but ſcarſ ſolid: for that common Grace <note place="margin">Refut.</note> which ſavs none, is not Goſpel Grace offered to al, nor deſervs that name; nor indeed is any ſuch, ſith it never produced the effect: Nor can a ſpecial ſuperabundant Grace be it, ſith 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by none to whom 'tis offered: but tru Goſpel Grace is received by ſom, and refuſed or reſiſted by others. Theſ three Opinions infer a kind of deſpair into mens minds, becauſ none ſhal be ſaved by that ſpecial Grace given to a few according to Gods ſecret purpoſ; which whether he intends to giv or not, the general promiſes cannot aſſure to any Soul.</p>
            <p>4. The Lutherans with ſom Papiſts maintain, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <note place="margin">4 Opin.</note> to make Man a free Creature; but permit him to ſtand or fal; and to ſend his Son upon foreſight of his fal for redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of al, by a general conditionat Decree of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Perſeverance; with a ſpecial abſolut of electing ſuch as he knew would beleev and perſever under the means: but to paſſ by and damn the reſt, whom he foreſaw incredulous and impenitent; making Preſcience or Previſion the occaſion on which his Decrees proced.</p>
            <p>This is faulty in ſom points: 1. Becauſ ther is no ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Refut.</note> conditionat Predeſtination. 2. Becauſ the ſpecial Decree of Election makes Men chuſ God firſt, rather then God them, which is prepoſterous. 3. Becauſ the Decree of Juſtification and Condemnation is confounded with election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth. 4. Becauſ it allows no more <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> Grace given to the Elect then Reprobats, nor greater cauſ of gratitud. Yet this opinion rightly extends the objects of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not only to <hi>Adams</hi> fal; but to Chriſt Incarnat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on in the World: to the laſt end of al that ſhal perſever in Faith or unbeleef. This ſutes with Scripture, which builds
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168435:44"/> Predeſtination on Foreknowledg ſimply and properly taken at large: promiſing ſalvation to al beleevers which ſhal perſever to the end. Theſ four opinions (ech of which hath ſom peeces of truth) giv great light to this deep dark myſtery: for the firſt <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>5. Arminius</hi> (ſtartle not, he is no Bugbear; but a lat learned <note place="margin">5 Opin.</note> Proteſtant Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden</hi> after <hi>Junius</hi>) taught, That God by his infinit intellect knew al things as poſſible to be, if he would giv them being: and among al conceived this viſible World, with al Mankinds race, from firſt to laſt, every one in order, government, and event; yet only as poſſible, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: That ſom things might be neceſſary, ſom voluntary; ſom Cauſes, ſom Effects; ſom as ends, ſom as means; ſom his own acts, ſom of free Creatures; ſom good, ſom evil; ſom as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſom as puniſhments: That he knew how to order and vary al, or any part or perſon; ſo as other effects or ends might be produced then theſ now extant, if he otherwiſe willed: But deemed it good for manifeſtation of his Power, Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Mercy, to put this Worlds frame and order of Mankind (then only as poſſible) in execution or being. That he foreknew if he ſhould doo it, ſom particular perſons would by this order of means be brought to eternal life; and others by neglect or diſorder go to perdition through their own fault, if Juſtice be doon upon them.

               </hi> and execut al which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in du time: and in ſo doing predeſtinated ſom to life, ſom to death eternaly.

<pb facs="tcp:168435:45"/> from that order, wherby Men com to perdition.</p>
            <p>Hence Predeſtination is defined to be a Preparation of Gods <note place="margin">Definition.</note> benefits, wherby al are delivered which are freed: Or (as <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius</hi> fuller) the preparation of Gods Works which in his eternal Providence he foreknew he would doo, either merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or juſtly. Here two things are to be obſerved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Predeſtination: 1. An act of Gods underſtanding, in reſpect of things not in being, caled Preſcience; which in order of Nature preceds al Decrees, as preſpecified. 2. An act of his Wil, which is proper to Predeſtination: for <hi>God works accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Council of his Wil,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. Theſ two acts <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 1, 2. Rom. 8. 28.</note> being coeternal, hav priority of order only, not of time; and Preſcience put as the firſt link by S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> This Tenet of ſimple Preſcience previous to Predeſtination, advanceth al Gods Attributs more then the four former: 1. His Wiſdom and Knowledg in foreſeing not only his own Works, but thoſ of free Creatures, and al circumſtances of each, how to govern them for his glory, in permiſſion of ſin, and obedience or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Grace, that he may judg the World righteouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. His power in creating and governing al things, bringing light out of darknes, life out of death, happines out of miſery. 3. His goodnes in making al good, and overcoming evil with good. 4. His univerſal Grace and Mercy in preparing a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Redemption for al Men, who were becom ſlavs to ſin and Satan; and ordaining means to apply or accomodat the ſame. 5. His truth in extending his promiſes to al that ſhal keep the Covenants or Conditions: for he is truth who ſpeaks no other then as he ordains, nor intends otherwiſe then as he ſpeaks. 6. His Juſtice in puniſhing al that uſe not the rectitud of their Nature, or benefit of Redemption offred. 7. His ſpecial Grace or ſingular lov in confirming them (as he did the good Angels) whom he foreſaw would uſe his Grace if it were given, in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the means which ſhould bring them to Glory: ſhewing leſſ Grace to thoſ whom he foreſaw would fail by their own incredulity, ingratitud or obſtinacy; whom he could hav cured by bettering his benefits; but decreed to make Veſſels of wrath by their own deſerts. 8. His dominion and ſoveraign Lordſhip, in that being ſuprem Ruler, he orders al after his free pleaſure;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168435:45"/> chuſing or refuſing whom he wil, becauſ they wilfully forſake him: as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, the Father excels in Wiſdom, becauſ he ſavs whom he ought, and judges ſuch as are worthy of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to be counted cruelty, conſidering his foregoing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting goodnes. 9. It excluds Stoical Fate, which the three firſt Opinions making Mans ſalvation or damnation neceſſary by an antecedent abſolut Decree, cannot poſſibly decline: wheras this, by placing it in order after Preſcience, makes both infallible to his knowledg (which, as ſimple ſcience, is no cauſ) but free and contingent to Man; who muſt work out his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by coworking with divine Grace; or incur damnation by refuſing his Mercy extended to al. 10. It makes Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction abſolut, immutable, and irrevocable, wherby he chuſeth Man; and not contrarily: but the fourth opinion is liable to theſ imputations. 11. It diverts deſpair on the one ſide (which too many fal into, ſuppoſing themſelfs decreed to damnation) and prevents preſumption on the other, which ſom confiding too far on infallable certitud of ſalvation and final perſeverance, hav becom their own Butchers to accelerat their glory; as may be ſhewed by ſundry inſtances in both kinds. 12. It miniſters much matter of comfort to the Godly, which walk in the wais leading to life; confirming their ſaving Faith in Chriſt and lov toward God. Laſtly, It magnifies the deepnes of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and inſcrutablenes of his Counſils: for who can conject, why he loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> or decreed to elect <hi>Peter</hi> and reject <hi>Judas;</hi> or ſavs one and ſuffers another to periſh, who could diſpoſe them to contrary ends? al which proceds from his Preſcience; ſith none is rejected, but upon previſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing life offered; and ther is ſufficient Grace in the means of converſion, to Remedy the weaknes or perverſnes of depraved Nature: Nor is any decreed to ſalvation, but upon foreſeen readines to accept life offered: and Gods general promiſes hav conditions, which Men by his Grace muſt obſerv on their part, if they wil partak the benefit.</p>
            <p>For God decreeing to make Man a free Creature in al his <note place="margin">Corollary.</note> actions, and foreſeing his fal, wherby he forfeted that liberty of Wil for himſelf and Poſterity in al ſpiritual ſupernatural Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; permitted Men to uſe or abuſe it in al other matters of this
<pb facs="tcp:168435:46"/> life (Natural, Moral, Civil) as Man had before his lapſ: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, according to his firſt precept or privilege of <hi>increaſ and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply;</hi> Parents beget Children in a corrupt Nature, but better or worſ diſpoſed and inclined: which is greatly altered and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Virtu and Vice by better or worſ education, good or il company and diverſ other concurring circumſtances. This makes ſom by pious tutorage becom more apt to embrace Gods Grace and cooperat with it, which draws willing, not nilling minds. But others by bad breeding, il company, and other lewd incentivs, grow obſtinat and obdurat, like deaf Adders which wil not be charmed. Al which God in his infinit Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience foreſeing, choſ ſom to be Veſſels of honor, and paſſed by the reſt to periſh in the ſuds of their ſins, through wilful impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, infidelity, and impenitency: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes Preſcience <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> the prime link of Predeſtinations golden Chain.</p>
            <p>Next folow ſom particular points appendent to be briefly agitated, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Knowledg, Wil, Providence, Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Election, Reprobation before Time: Creation, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Man under the Covenant of Works, Mans fal with its effects, Mans Government under the Covenant of Grace: by Caling, concurrence of the Word and Spirit, Converſion, Grace, Freewil, with both jointly, Regeneration, Perſeverance, and laſt Judgment, al doon or to be doon in Time.</p>
            <p>This is a large field, which tends to unfold the verity of this myſtery. 1. For divine knowledg, S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>known to God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Divine Knowledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>are al his works from everlaſting:</hi> S. <hi>Paul, whom he foreknew, he predeſtinated:</hi> S. <hi>Peter, To the ſtrangers elect according to Gods foreknowledg.</hi> Som interpret Preſcience by Precognition, preſuppoſing lov or approbation, rather than ſimple ſcience: but this is a very verbal nicity; for the Greek word <hi>(Prognoſis)</hi> properly imports foreknowledg, but approbation arbitrarily: as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>God knoweth (i.</hi> approveth) <hi>the way of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 6.</note> yet it folows not from the bare word: for if <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> make foreknow and predeſtinat, or foreknow and elect or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov al one; then they refer the act of his Underſtanding to the Wil (yet our Wil is guided by the Intellect, and that by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) imputing to Foreknowledg what properly belongs to Predeſtination and Election: fith approbation is more diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168435:46"/> by the Act of Wil, which is to Predeſtinat and Elect; then by that of underſtanding, which is to foreknow. Yet if with <hi>Origen,</hi> they wil join Preſcience with his good liking or approving the ſubject foreknown, as capable of chuſing; it ſhal be granted: for in Scripture only the elect are ſtiled <hi>Praeſciti,</hi> not Reprobats; though they alſo are foreknown ſimply, but not with approbation, which hinders not his ſimple foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, nor infers any argument, that men are choſen for any good approved in them; nor that they muſt be choſen becauſ good in Gods knowledg: For God might ſee many Worlds of Men (to be created, if he pleaſed, whom he hath covered in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of never being) ſo eligible as thoſ whom he hath choſen; ſith to be eligible and elect are two diſtinct things, which doo not folow one another. For cleering wherof, his duple know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſimple Intelligence (which is of al things poſſible or comprehenſible by his Omnipotence) and of Viſion (which is of things that ſhal be by his Decree depending on his Wil) muſt be wel weighed.</p>
            <p>Here two doubts occur: 1. Whether the objects of theſ <note place="margin">1 Doubt.</note> Knowledges (poſſible and future) be divided, ſo that poſſibles pertain ſoly to pure Intelligence, and future to that of Viſion? as if the ſame things cannot be firſt known as poſſible to ſimple Intelligence; and after as future (the divine Decree intervening to make them future) to be objects of Viſion.</p>
            <p>This is eaſily reſolved, That knowledg is no cauſ of things, <note place="margin">Reſolution.</note> unles his Wil concur: for 'tis not from his knowledg that things are, but only that they may be. <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, God created al things, having the Idea, form, or model firſt in his mind: for what Artiſan doth any thing, whoſ patern he conceived not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? So S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> God made nothing ignorantly, as no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt <note place="margin">L. 11. de Civ. c. 10.</note> or Architect doth: whence we ſee a kind of miracle, yet truth; that this World could not be known to us unles it had bin; but unles God had known it before it was, it never had bin. Dr. <hi>Prydeaux</hi> in his <hi>Scientia media</hi> ſaith, That God is cauſ of al things which he framed, not ſimply in himſelf; but by his Wil adjoined: For his knowledg of pure Underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects al things poſſible; that of Viſion only future, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth al to be by concurrence of his Wil. So ſimple Intelligence
<pb facs="tcp:168435:47"/> preceds al acts of Wil, wherby the ſame things reſpected as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, are now looked on as future; becauſ the act of his Wil ſupervening, makes them to be future in their times.</p>
            <p>2. The next doubt is, whether future, contingent, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <note place="margin">2 Doubt.</note> things (ſpecialy free acts of a created Wil placed in this or that order) be a ſubject of Gods ſimple Intelligence? becauſ ſuch as diſlike the Jeſuits <hi>Scientia media</hi> ſay, that the object hereof is nul, and therfore the knowledg taken away: for al acts of Free-wil are determined by divine Decree; ſo that God no otherwiſe foreknows they ſhal be, then becauſ he decreed them to be.</p>
            <p>This middle Science partakes more of ſimple Intelligence <note place="margin">Reſolut.</note> then free knowledg; which ſees no more then a poſſibility of things in futurition only, upon a ſuppoſition if God make them to be by his word <hi>Fiat.</hi> For al agree, That before God decreed to creat, he had a certain abſolut knowledg of al things (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, paſt, future, contingent, neceſſary) together with al their connexions; and after knows conditionat things to com: but the Queſtion is, whether he knows them by pure Underſtanding (which foreruns al Decrees of his Wil) that they ſhal abſolutly be; or by Viſion while they lay ſuſpended under Gods free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, whether they ſhould be or no? for God by his infinit eſſence knows what ſhal be neceſſarily, and what ſhal com to paſſ by his Wil. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> beſt reſolvs both doubts, That God by his ſimple Underſtanding knew Man would fal if he were made, before he willed to creat him; for things neceſſary are in God firſt, then the voluntary: but 'tis neceſſary for God to know al things poſſible, elſ he cannot be Omniſcient, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary only that he ſhould decree to make Man. If then God hath a ſimple Intelligence, he can ſhew it in no act more then Predeſtination: for as 'tis the firſt and higheſt act of his Wil, ſo is that of his underſtanding; and the wiſeſt Agent willeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he perfectly knew and underſtood.</p>
            <p>Now the firſt Opinion excluds al uſe of Preſcience, referring <note place="margin">Application.</note> al to his free Pleaſure, which with al their fine diſtinctions and ſimilituds can hardly free him from being the Author of ſin. The ſecund acknowledgeth his ſimple Preſcience of Mans fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fal, if he were created, before he decreed to creat: but why
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168435:47"/> they ſhould not extend it to al Mens free acts ſo wel as to that one of the firſt Mans, no reaſon can be rendred. God foreknew if Chriſt were ſent to the Jews, they would deſpiſe him; if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhould be tempted, he would deny him, even before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſend Chriſt, or to creat <hi>Peter.</hi> But if it be asked, <label type="milestone">

This is al they intend, who refer Chriſt and faith in him to pure Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, before the act of Electing or Predeſtinating, not ſtaying at the knowledg of Mans foreſeen fal: not that they make Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers faith any Cauſ of Gods Predeſtination; but only an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſimple Preſcience, concurring with his good pleaſure and Wil, to make ſom Veſſels of honor, and ſom of diſhonor. Howbeit People are taught to admire or adore ſom Men as Oracles, and abhor others as Scorpions, whoſ Tenets they know not.</p>
            <p>2. Touching Gods Wil, which Predeſtinats or decrees <note place="margin">2 Gods Wil.</note> what of thoſ infinit things preſented by his underſtanding ſhal com into being: for unles both Wil and Power conjoin, their being known is not enough to be: For Gods Wil being in it ſelf one and ſimple (not duple, ſecret and reveled) may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered diverſly, as converſant about diverſ things. 1. Som as to be doon by himſelf, or his own power; as the World to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of nothing; his Son to be ſent made of a Woman, &amp;c. which never fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, becauſ he works alone. 2. Som which he wils to be doon by his Creatures, either Natural Agents, as Flowers to grow by Sun; or Voluntary, as righteous Works to be wrought by ſinful Men, but with his concurrence or coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this often fails by the Creatures failing which he wils to work it; yet permits and not hinders the failing, as he could doo. 3. Som which he wils and doth of himſelf, or with others; as al the good we hav in Nature or Grace: part wherof he doth as leading or antecedent of his free goodnes, caled the Wil of
<pb facs="tcp:168435:48"/> his Mercy; part as folowing, led or urged, upon occaſion of evil in the Creature; as to forſake puniſh or deſtroy; which is the Wil of his Juſtice. Theſ may wel cohere; as a Merchants chief wil is in a ſtorm, to ſav al his goods; yet by a ſecund wil, caſts ſom into Sea. So God wils al Men to be ſaved, as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but permits ſom to periſh, as impenitent ſinners. The firſt act of Gods Wil in chuſing things to be; and refuſing the reſt, of infinit variety, which might hav bin if he would, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with his ſimple Intelligence; ther being an act of his Wil even in knowing; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath doon whatever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him:</hi> but the ſecund, wherby he decreed al things which concern Creation, Election, Reprobation, &amp;c. preſuppoſeth pure preſcience, as previous in order of Nature, according to our apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>3. Of Providence concerning Gods Decree or Wil in al <note place="margin">3 Providence and Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> things ſav about Man; and Predeſtination, wherby he decrees touching Man the principal part of his Providence (as Fortune concerns Man, and Chance al things elſ) which laſt is an act of his Wil from eternity, decreeing the ends of al Men, and means which he foreknew would bring them to thoſ ends of Life or Death. So by Predeſtinating ſom to thoſ means, which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew by their own obſtinacy (not by any inſufficience of the means, ſith others by the ſame attain it) wil not bring them to Life, becoms a negativ Reprobation, by their own default or diſobedience, or by their fault who hav charge over their Souls: but that God hinders it not or givs not effectual Grace (which he knew would ſav them if given) proceds ſoly from his juſt Wil and free pleaſure. Nor can this be rightly nicknamed Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination (as ſom aſperſ it) ſith it folows his ſimple ſcience: and knowledg is not of things abſolutly to be, but conditionaly, if it pleaſ him to ſay, they ſhal be.</p>
            <p>4. Anent Election and Reprobation, wherin God uſeth <note place="margin">4 Election and Reprobation.</note> both Knowledg and Wil; as the Scriptures ſomtime ſtile the Elect from one <hi>of thoſe whom he foreknew;</hi> ſomtime from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>thoſ whom he predeſtinated according to purpoſ or Wil:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 2. Rom. 8. 28.</note> hence they may be deſcribed either way; <hi>viz.</hi> Election is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of Gods benefits, wherby a man wil be ſaved, if they be given him: Or election is Gods purpoſ and Wil to giv Man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168435:48"/> thoſ benefits, by which he knows he wil be ſaved, if given him. So Reprobation is a foreknowledg of Gods benefits, under which a Man, through his own ingratitud wil periſh, if no other be given or wil be given: Or 'tis Gods Decree, to giv a Man no other benefits then thoſ, under which he foreknows he wil by his own wilful ingratitud periſh, if no other be given. Here Preſcience looks preciſely on Mans ingrat neglect of ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and Gods wil denies to giv any new, or more then thoſ which are ineffectual by their abuſe or neglect. So God hath mercy on whom he wil, and hardens whom he pleaſeth: giving to one Grace of repentance, and leaving the other in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by withholding thoſ Graces, which he knows would ſav him, if granted. Not as if he gav not ſufficient to life; for he received the Graces given in vain, and God would confer no more: for to harden is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſubtract al Grace ſufficient to ſalvation, but to bar or withold that high hidden Grace of his Power and Wil, which he knows would convert and ſav, if gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but that it would be refuſed. Thus Man firſt hardens his <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. 8. Exod. 8. 15.</note> own heart (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did) by refuſing Grace offered; and God ſecundarily, in not adding or increaſing ſtronger Graces, which would mollify if given. But if they were extended to al, none could periſh; for 'tis his pleaſure to exerciſe Juſtice on wilful deſpiſers of his ſufficient Grace by making them Veſſels of wrath; and mercy on thoſ whom he foreſaw would obey his Cal. Let profound <hi>Hooker</hi> put a period to this point: That <note place="margin">L. 5. part. 5.</note> which moveth God to work is goodnes; which orders it, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which perfects it, Power; al things produced in their times were eternaly in him, as a work unbegan in the Artificer, which he after frameth: therfore whatever we behold in this World, was inwrapped in the bowels of divine Mercy, writ in the Book of eternal Wiſdom, and held in the hands of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power, the foundation being yet unlaid. So al things in that reſpect are his Of-ſpring (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) being effects in <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28, 29</note> their higheſt Cauſ, who alſo is actualy in them, and the aſſiſting influence of his Deity their Life. Let hereto ſaving Grace be added, which begets a ſpecial Of-ſpring of Men, to whom he givs the gracious name of Sons. We are by nature <hi>Adams</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and God in creating him created us al, and ſo many as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb facs="tcp:168435:49"/> from him, hav the root from which they ſpring: But al are not Sons of God, nor any one ſav by Grace and favor. The Sons of God hav his own Natural Son as a ſecund <hi>Adam</hi> from Heaven, and ſuch as deſcend from him hav the root from which they ſpring, whoſ tru Progeny they are by ſpiritual birth. God therfore loving his Son eternaly, muſt needs lov eternaly &amp; prefer them before al others, which ſince ſpiritualy ſprung from him. Theſ were in God as their Saviour, not as their Creator on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: It was the purpoſ of his ſaving Goodnes, ſaving Wiſdom, and ſaving Power, which inclined toward them, ſuch as were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly in God by intended admiſſion to Life, have God by voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or adoption actualy abiding in them, as an Artiſan is in the Work, which hand is preſently to frame. We are therefore in God eternaly through Chriſt, according to that purpoſ, wherby we were choſen to be made his, through the knowledg had of us, and lov born towards us from everlaſting; but are actualy no longer in God then from the time of our adoption into the body of the tru Church, or felowſhip of his Children: for he knows and lovs his Church; ſo that al which are in it, are therby known to be in him. For our being in Chriſt by eternal foreknowledg ſaveth us not, without actual adoption into the ſociety of Saints here: for we are in him by actual incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into that Communion, which hath him for their Head. Thus he.</p>

            <p>6. Government of Man under the Covenant of Works, <note place="margin">6 Government</note> which is the ſecund temporal act of Gods eternal Counſil; that Man might uſe his perfections, and attain the end: wherin God, as ſuprem Lord, was to command; and Man, as Vaſlal, obey. Yet it pleaſed his Goodnes to com into Covenant with him, as a free Rational Creature (<hi>Doo this, and thou ſhalt liv</hi>) caled the Covenant of Works. For the Natural moral Law, writen in Mans heart, compriſed al works to be doon by him: but the poſitiv prohibitiv Precept (<hi>not to eat of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden</hi>) only a trial or experiment of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and exerciſe of the moral Law duties in that one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; becauſ Man was to obſerv them, and God to perform the Promiſſ or Covenant of life, if he kept them faithfully.</p>

Theſ effects fel on <hi>Adam</hi> and al his Poſterity: ſith he was not as one ſingle perſon only; but Mankinds whol Nature: for God might juſtly hav rejected and condemned al the race in him the root, which brought ſo bitter fruits: Yet he promiſed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to al that wil return to him, and preſcribed means of remedy, If they wil apply them, being offered by Grace in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, who died for the ſins of al Mankind in general.</p>
            <p>9. Government of Man under the Covenant of Grace; <note place="margin">9 Covenant of Grace.</note> which God ordained to reſtore him, being falen, that his end of creating might not be quit fruſtrat by Satans fraud, though he
<pb facs="tcp:168435:50"/>
               <note place="margin">L. 3. 0. 33.</note> permitted it. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, God ordered Mans ſalvation at his good pleaſure, that he might not be overcom by the Serpents craft, to deſtroy al Mankind; nor his skil impaired to ſav whom he willed. To this end he decreed, that <hi>the Womans ſeed ſhal break the Serpents head;</hi> wherby he might be reduced from Hel, and ſet in a fair way to Heaven; on condition of a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, tending to the ſame ends of righteouſnes and life; which, partly by the remains of Gods Image, and partly by ſupply of his propitious help, he was capable to obſerv; elſ were the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant vain. 'Tis caled a Covenant of Grace; yet tru or real, wherin both parties are to perform their parts. 1. God to ſend his Son and Spirit for Mans relief, to forgiv his ſins, imput righteouſnes, and giv life to al that ſhal obey his Son and Spirit: <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> So <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>This ſhal be my Covenant, ſaith the Lord: I wil put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: I wil be their God, and they ſhal be my People.</hi> This is a Covenant of Grace, becauſ freely pacted with Man a ſinner, whoſ ſalvation is wrought rather by God then himſelf; being more in receiving then giving, and in beleeving then doing. 2. Man is to humble himſelf for his ſins, to God the Creator; to beleev in Chriſt the Redeemer, and be led by the holy Spirit the Sanctifier. This part is unfolded in the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience: Which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made to al Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> as the ſtock of al their Seed. For ſom remnents of Gods Image (Life, Knowledg of good and il, liberty of Wil in Natural, Moral, and Civil things; Conſcience accuſing or excuſing) are ſtil left after the fal: which, though given at Creation, and ſo belong to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet to retain them, is of Grace, both by giving capacity to contract or Covenant, and to be a beginning of his reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſith theſ alone be not able to raiſ him or recover righteouſnes, or keep the new Covenant by his old remains, God being no hard Task-maſter or Covenant maker, ſupplies by his Spirit what is farther needful to keep it, ſith none is bound to impoſſibilities. Upon this keeping the new Covenant, depends the eternal Bliſſ or bale and wo of every Man, which he muſt obediently obſerv.</p>

               <note place="margin">10 Caling.</note> 10. Diſpenſation of the Covenant by Caling; which is a proclaming
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168435:50"/> therof from time to time, by preaching the Word; elſ it would ſoon be forſaken, forgoten, and ſlighted. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> conjoins with Predeſtinating, as he puts Preſcience before it: which is defined to be a revelation or proclamation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Covenant, injoining repentance toward God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; promiſing remiſſion of ſins, and life eternal to al that obey. It conſiſts of two eſſential parts or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acts, to make one complet work of Vocation; <hi>viz.</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern preaching of the Word (wherto belong Sacraments, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Corrections) and intern operation of the Spirit, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying or aſſiſting the outer means. This Caling hath bin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed diverſly by Gods Wiſdom and good Pleaſure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference of Times.</p>
            <p>1. In the old Teſtament, before Chriſts coming; as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means and meaſure of the Spirits operation, with effects ſutable to both: When the bounds were narrower, the Word obſcurer, the Sacraments more myſterious, the Spirit more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and obedience ſlenderer then under the new Teſtament: for from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Confuſion of Toungs, the caling was univerſal, being al one language under the righteous Patriarchs: But afterward God permitting Men (which forſook their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <note place="margin">Pſ. 147. 19, 26.</note> Fathers) to walk their own waies; renewed his Caling or Covenant with <hi>Abram</hi> and his Seed, contracting the bounds <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> of his Church. The Gentils then were al under wrath and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, without God in the World, Aliens from the Covenant of Promiſſ. For as the Church excommunicats ungodly perſons, ſo God excluds unworthy Nations for many generations, to puniſh their ingratitud and contempt of his Word; or to make future Ages cleav faſter to him by default of former, being left to themſelfs. The myſtery of whoſ Judgments (why he one while ſhuts out Gentils, admitting the Jews; another extruds the Jews, receiving the Gentils) is admirable and inſcrutable: <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 25. 33</note> But why he left al to Covenant with <hi>Abram</hi> and his Seed, no reaſon can be rendred, ſav only his free Grace, <hi>not of Works, but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 9. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>of him that caleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Under the new Teſtament, after Chriſts coming: which outwardly hath the Word and Sacraments, exhibiting Chriſt with his benefits more cleerly: And inwardly more abundant
<pb facs="tcp:168435:51"/> meaſure of the Spirit intended to multituds of Nations, with greater fruits of mens converſion then under the old Teſtament. This is termed the caling of the Gentils, when Jews were ſhut out, til their time ſhal com. Here Gods Judgments are to be admired, why he witholds from the Jews his inward illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit and ſoftning Grace, which he grants to Gentils? keeping ſtil his word or outer Caling, from many Nations which never heard of Chriſt, no more then the old Heathen: But we that be under the Grace of Gods caling, muſt be more thankful for it, and more careful that it be not conferred in vain upon us. Diverſ Divines make Caling duple: 1. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Word only, common to Reprobats, and never obeied with truth of heart, being ineffectual. 2. Inward of the Spirit joined with the Word, peculiar to the Elect and never diſobeied, which is effectual. This is not orthodox, ſith ther is but one Caling both of the Word and Spirit, as Body and Soul; which is effectual in it ſelf to al under it: but if it fail, the fault is in the Caled, which obey it not: For the Spirit goes not ſo with the Word; as to make Man perform what he can by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength, ſith 'tis given to help Natures failings; but to keep it waking and attentiv: So if the Spirit be not preſent with the Word to ſom, 'tis becauſ they are not preſent to it, through their ſtupid ſupine ſecurity. Nor is the concurrence of Word and Spirit natural, neceſſary, or inſeparable; but free or arbitrary in Gods good pleaſure. For as Grace is annexed to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo is it to the Word by divine ordinance: Hence the Church, before Sermons, prais for the Spirits illumining power, to concur with the Word; which God expects he ſhould ask, who is to pray for himſelf and others. Another defect why the Spirit doth not ſtil work with the Word is, when 'tis not duly and diligently asked. Som alſo are paſt Grace, given to Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ſenſ; to whom the Spirit is not preſent with the Word for former contempt or neglect in their Viſitation, when God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; who now givs them up to blindnes and hardnes, holding back the light of his Spirit and dew of Grace from the Word preached in their hearing; though Men know them not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and ſo admit al.</p>
            <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh betwen the word Caling, Perſons Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168435:51"/> and operations of the Spirit with the Word in them. The Word is duple. 1. The Law, which hath two parts; <hi>viz.</hi> the <note place="margin">1 The Law.</note> Precepts, to accuſe or convince; and the Curſ for al tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors therof, to wound or kil. The Perſons Caled by Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, uſing the Law, are al natural unregenerat ſinners; or Regenerats relapſed into grievous ſins; who are either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their evil eſtate, to whom Law-precepts muſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make them know their ſin; or know it but are ſecure and ſenſleſſ of their carnal condition; and to ſuch the curſ muſt be denounced. The Spirits operations on theſ by Laws miniſtry, are to open their eyes and prick their hearts with fear of the Curſ: which effects the Spirit, with the letter of the Law, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily produceth, by working on thoſ remains of light left in the mind, and of Conſcience accuſing: which works are wrought in many Reprobats, who hav ſom initial parts of Grace, as Papiſts grant.</p>
            <p>2. The Goſpel which hath a Precept to repent of ſin ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">2 Goſpel.</note> by the Law, and beleev in Chriſt, who givs life wher the Law-Curſ killeth; with a Promiſſ of ſins remiſſion, and eternal life <note place="margin">Acts 2 38, 39.</note> to al that repent and beleev. The Perſons caled in the words of the Goſpel are al ſorts of ſinners; but convict, terrified, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> ful of compunction, and ſelf-condemning; wrought by the Spirit in preaching the Law. The Spirits operations on ſuch by the Goſpels miniſtry, are to open their eyes to ſee the light of Gods marvellous mercy toward ſinners; of Chriſts infinit lov in dying for them, the ineſtimable merits of his death; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Gifts, Graces, and aids of the holy Ghoſt: To pour into ſinners hearts hope, which ſhal ſtay them from deſperat ſinning: To inſpire the Grace of praier, that they may eſcape the wrath to com, and receiv Gods favor: to beget repentance and work Faith; that they rely wholy on him, and caſt themſelfs into the arms of his goodnes, to be ſaved by him. Theſ Graces the holy Ghoſt is ſtil ready to work by the Goſpel in a repentant ſinner, humbled and prepared by the Law: for what proportion of power the Spirit had in the Law on Unregenerats, to humble them; the ſame it hath in the Goſpel on the humbled, to work hope and infer the other Graces of Praier, Repentance, Faith, Juſtification, Mortification, Vivification, and new Obedience.
<pb facs="tcp:168435:52"/> Howbeit if the Spirit is not preſent in preaching the Law, to giv Unregenerats ſtrength of new obedience, becauſ 'tis preſent to convince and condemn their wickednes: Nor is it preſent in preaching the Goſpel to one not yet penitent or beleeving, to giv new obedience or work Peace, Joy, and Lov, as it doth in Beleevers; for ſuch degrees com not <hi>per ſaltum.</hi> The ſum is, Gods Spirit is annexed to his Word for ſuch Gifts and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as the hearer is a fit diſpoſed ſubject to receiv: for God works by order of things antecedent or preparativ; which, if they find no admiſſion, the ſubſequent are ſuſpended. Hence coms the frequent juſt ſeparation of the Spirit by the word by the great Paſtor of Souls, who ſercheth the heart and renes. To prov this point, that Gods Word in the Law and Goſpel, is perfect and powerful to convert Souls, read <hi>Pſal. 9. 7. Joh. 17. 17. Joh. 20. 21. 2 Cor. 3. 8. Heb.</hi> 4 12. wher the Goſpel is caled <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> not of the Letter; becauſ it givs what it commands: but the Law commands and givs no help: for, <hi>the Law was given by Moſes</hi> (not hearts to receiv it) <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but Grace and Truth cam by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John.</hi> To prov that Caling is al one to them that obey not and obey, Chriſts words are cleer; <hi>Many are caled, but few choſen:</hi> Here <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 14.</note> two ſorts are ſpecified; ſom caled, but not choſen; and ſom caled and choſen of thoſ many; yet the Caling one of both: which is not by the outward Word alone, for by it none are choſen; but by the Word and Spirit in common: So the few choſen excelled not in number or Caling, but in obeying when the reſt refuſed, as the Sun hardens clay and melts wax. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Ninivets ſhal riſe in judgment with this generation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 41.</note> 
               <hi>and condemn it:</hi> If <hi>Jonas</hi> preached without the Spirit, how did they repent?

The Jews exemple confirms the ſame, being yet uncaled; not becauſ they liv without the Goſpels ſound, ſith they converſ ſcatterdly with Chriſtians, and may hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or read Scriptures: but becauſ they perſiſt obdurat, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168435:52"/> reject the illumining ſoftning Spirit, often offered: therfore the diſtinction of Caling into outward ineffectual; and inward effectual is falſ or frivolous. Bare preaching may be a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, like the Law; not a Caling, as the Goſpel: for God may ſtil require obedience as a natural duty, ſith he created Man able; but becauſ the new Covenant cals Men to Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, being unable to riſe or recover of themſelfs; it were a mock, and no cal to ſay, turn, repent, beleev, and liv, unles ſom Grace be prepared to doo it. The effect of this Caling is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to one cauſ chefly, the Spirits operation; yet ther be mo, and if any fails, the effect fals: for obedience to Gods Caling is an act of Mans wil, under aid of the Spirit, which is oft refuſed or reſiſted, and Grace offered in vain; ſith God doth not croſſ the courſ of the ſecund Cauſes, eſtabliſhed at firſt. It alſo makes Gods Covenant differ from al other, in which no party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms al, but ech a part for himſelf: wheras here God is made to perform al pacts and promiſes for both; who only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to make his conditions feaſible, and afford his help ſo far as is needful, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> intimats: For 'tis not ſafe to rely ſoly on <note place="margin">Iſai 59. 21.</note> Gods abſolut Wil, as if we were tied to nothing; or to gul our ſelfs, as if God required nothing of us: For this Covenant of Grace hath ſom conditions for Man to fulfil, which by Gods univerſal Grace he is able to doo, as ſhal be ſhewed.</p>

            <p>12. Gods Grace is al that proceds from him of free favour, <note place="margin">12 Free Grace univerſal.</note> tending to a ſinners ſalvation: wherby is not meant the remains of Nature (as ſom light of Reaſon, ſenſ of Conſcience; though theſ by Grace, were left after the Fal) nor the Law deſcribing the righteouſnes of Works, though the Preacher of Grace uſeth it to prepare a ſinner for Chriſt; nor the bare outward Word of the Goſpel, though cal'd the Word of Grace, becauſ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace goes with it: but only the inward illuminations, teachings, tractions, motions, operations, inſpirations, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, merited by Chriſt for <hi>Adams</hi> ſons, in their time and order, to raiſ them faln, and ſav them loſt; which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> terms the Grace of Chriſt. For in Man is no merit of Grace, but only an occaſion of God to ſhew it; which yet he is free to receiv or refuſe: Nor is the good uſe of former Graces any merit or cauſ of giving mo; which are ſo freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the firſt, elſ Grace were no Grace. This Grace being one in eſſence, hath diverſ denominations, according to the difference of relations and effects: the moſt uſual diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is into preventing, working, or exciting Grace; and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, coworking, or helping: but to divide it into ſufficient and efficacious, is an idle buz: For how can it be Grace or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which never produceth any effect? ſith if it becom effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, it loſeth the name of ſufficient, and is one with the other; for al Grace in it ſelf is ſufficient or efficient alike; but the defect in the ſubject or ſom other cauſ: Yet Grace may be caled effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual from the event as iſſuing from Gods ſpecial mercy guided by Preſcience, not elſ. Lapſed Man hath a neceſſity of Grace, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> maintains againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who denied original ſin, or any loſſ to <hi>Adams</hi> Of-ſpring by his fal; holding Mankind ſo ſound as God made it, as ther needs no Grace: al which are groſſ errors. For Man without God, can doo no good, becauſ the Commandments are beyond his ſtrength without Grace,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168435:53"/> to which nothing is impoſſible: and 'tis moſt juſt the Creature ſhould rely on the Creator, that he may ſtil apply to him. The Air is not a lucid body like the Sun; for then it would continu ſo ſtil in abſence of his light: So Man is illightned by Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but in his abſence immediatly darkned, whom we forſake wilfully. The power of Grace is glorious, ſuch as wrought in Chriſt when he roſe from the dead; whence our converſion is <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19, 20.</note> caled a new Birth, a new Creation, and firſt Reſurrection.

So al freedom of wil to ſpiritual ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural good is forfeted in Mans Nature faln, unles it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed or reſtored by Grace of Chriſt, which goes with the Goſpel: but if the Son make us free, we ſhal be free indeed; elſ not.</p>
            <p>Ther is a triple ſpiritual good, wherto freedom is reſtored by Grace: 1.

               </gap> Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as to repent and beleev: herein Man hath no Free-wil left, but the ſame Goſpel brings freedom two waies: 1. By framing the Commandments ſo facil or feaſible to the wils weaknes, as may be a proportion between it and them; wherby Goſpel Grace ſhal apply or accommodat the work to the Workman, or task to the Laborer. 2. By giving the Wil ſo much help or power as is requiſit to inable a ſinner, though it
<pb facs="tcp:168435:55"/> be a task ſo hard and heavy as the works of the Law. To repent of ſin, beleev in Gods Mercy, and reſt on his Sons merits, ſeem to be acts very mercifully prepared, as fitteſt to a ſinners weak condition: yet this way of freedom is not ſo evident as the later, which prevents the wil, and prepares it by infuſing Grace, to wil ſpiritual good required, in that order or proportion as is preſcribed to depraved Nature aſſiſted by Grace, which brings power with it to quicken the dead, ſtrengthen the impotent, and looſen the Captiv: wherby Goſpel Precepts are made lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obeied by Man lapſed, which the Law doth not inable: ſo that none can be excuſed in diſobeying them, for want of power to repent or beleev.</p>
            <p>Free-wil on the left hand to evil, is under Gods Grace or notwithſtanding it; wherby one may wil good, or decline to evil. This in <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſingle innocent poſſibility or a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mutability toward evil; ſith God only is immutably good. So <hi>Adams</hi> ſupernatural Grace given to corroborat him, did not immobilitat his wil to evil: for he is praiſ-worthy, who can tranſgreſſ and wil not; not he that is good, and can be no other; as ſom ſay Grace cannot be reſiſted. This natural free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to evil (caled <hi>reſiſtentia connata</hi>) remains in Man falen, and is not removed by Grace; but ther is added <hi>reſiſtentia ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> or a precipitat proclivity to evil, by thraldom to Satans tyranny and dominion. So the natural freedom to ſin, is not in it ſelf evil; but the uſe and practiſ only: yet prones to evil, and ſervitud to ſin, which is in us ſince the Fal, is evil. Theſ differ ſo much as a mortal man living, and one actualy dead: The firſt Grace takes not away in this life, but eſſais to remov the other, and to weaken or reſtrain it; preſerving the natural freedom to evil ſtil. This Doctor <hi>Baro,</hi> in his learned Lectures on <hi>Jonas</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatly unfolds, which muſt be carefully heeded in this dark Theory.</p>
            <p>Free-wil (as Doctor <hi>Charlton</hi> in his abſtruſe Treatiſ inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>The darknes of Atheiſm diſpeld by Natures light ſhews</hi>) is not taken in <hi>Tullies</hi> ſenſ, for a liberty to liv as every one liſts; nor as the Civil Law intends, for freedom from ſervitud: but for what is properly in Mans power or diſpoſing, to elect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what object he wil, good or evil: which concerns only
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168435:55"/> Mans natural condition; wherto in equity, the reward of Piety or Virtu, and puniſhment of Impiety or Vice is ſoly du. This <hi>liberum Arbitrium</hi> is not only an aſſent or approbation, but an adheſion to that abov others, which the Mind or Intellect ſhal chuſ: for the eſſence of it conſiſts primarily in the Rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and dependently on the Wil; which in it ſelf is blind or undiſcerning, except guided by the Intellect to inform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it. Som Divines ſay Mans wil is moſt free, when 'tis ſo fixed on the chief Good, as it cannot wil Evil, becauſ the dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and fruition of that is voluntary, and therfore free. This is an evident error, by confounding ſpontaneous and voluntary actions: for a ſpontaneous is a blind impulſ of Nature, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on no foregoing deliberation; as Fire ſpontaneouſly mounts up, Bruts mov from place to place, Infants ſuck; without rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination or liberty of wil: but a voluntary arbitrary action depends on previous deliberation, dijudication, and delection; which is free indifferently to Good or Evil: So that if the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit be reſtrained only to Good; it may act ſpontaneouſly (as a ſtone movs downward) but not arbitrarily <hi>ad utrumlibet.</hi> They ſay the appetit confined to good is volent, and therfore free: but this volence is a meer libence, free from coactiv vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; no tru liberty to chuſ ſeveral objects; and therfore not arbitrary, becauſ bar'd of indifferency. They reply, that 'tis the perfection of Free-wil ſo to embrace Good, as not to be capable of evil. Tru, 'tis the perfection of Mans wil or appetit, ſo to enjoy tru Good (ſpecialy the chief) that nothing can divorce or divert it to ſeek any counterfet: Yet this is not the wils li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to either; nor incident to Man in this life, being a beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud of Souls ſeparat, which hav no other object ſav the tru <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> nor other appetit then a ful fix'd dilection therof.</p>
            <p>Thus Wil is guided by the Intellect, and this by Judgment which it givs concerning Good &amp; Evil objects; that this is good and that evil, or this more and that leſſ good. So when the wil is averted from one and converted to another; that mutation proceds from mutability of Intellectiv Judgment, which is now for one thing and anon for another: for the Intellect makes uſe of ſom notions caled ſimple apprehenſions, wherby it givs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:168435:56"/> of their Natures; as it hath a prenotion what Hony is, and what ſweetnes; yer it can judg Hony to be ſweet: But though in matters of ſpeculation it relies on this ſimple Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor can infer farther by neceſſary conſequent: yet in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reducible to action it hath a compound notion caled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Enunciation, immediatly annexed to the former ſimple notion and ſuperadded as a Concluſion, which is caled Practical Judgment: as when it judgeth Hony ſweet, it ads a ſecund complex notion, if ſweet 'tis to be taſted; and infers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a Concluſion, that Hony may be taſted. Now becauſ practical objects are ſingulars, the Intellect givs judgment that this preſent Hony is ſweet; and ſecundly infers that 'tis to be taſted, wherto the wil aſſents and chuſeth it. Hence <hi>Ariſtotl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> 
               <note place="margin">L. de motu Animal. c. 7.</note> allows no diſtinction between an action or execution, and a Concluſion; becauſ this reſulting from two Propoſitions is the very action, which he provs by ſeveral exemples: So this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which is the action it ſelf, wherto the execution co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres, is caled Practical Judgment. This action or execution of a Judgment cannot ſucced, unleſ the appetit or wil concurs: ſo that every judgment or notion of Good hath annexed an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of that Good; and every judgment of Evil, an averſion from it. So ſoon then as the Intellect judgeth a thing to be ſweet, and therfore to be taſted; up riſeth the appetit and wils actual deguſtation of this ſweet preſented, wher both Intellect and wil conjoin. Thus when the Intellect givs judgment of Good (which is the Wils proper object) the Wil is inſtantly incited to deſire fruition, which folows on the heels of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a ſhadow attends the Suns body: ſo that if the one judg it good, the other deſires it; if evil, the Wil declines it. Now becauſ the Intellect is moſtly fickle or inconſtant in judgment, the Wil no leſſ wavers or varies in appetition: ſo that when the one to day judgeth a thing good and to morow evil; the other affects it to day and abhors it to morow: ſo the Wil conforms wholy to the Intellects judgments concerning Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>Good is duple: 1. Tru or real. 2. Seeming or counterfet. So evil is either realy ſo, or gilded with the ſpecious ſhew of Good. Hence <hi>Cicero</hi> aptly compares it to a Ballance, which if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168435:56"/> Geometricaly adjuſted by dimidiation, is indifferent to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at either end or extrem, and ſo forced from its equilibry, or depreſſed at that ſide on which the greater weight is laid: As the contrary end may be depreſſed by over-poiſing it with a greater weight: Semblably the Intellect is in it ſelf indifferent, and inflected to that object, wherto the greater appeerance of <note place="margin">Verum &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> Truth or Good adheres; as it can upon a greater appeerance of either reflect to a ſecund, being ſtil led by veriſimility: for the Wil is as the Needle, and Intellect the Magnet, by whoſ verticity it turns parallel to the point of Good, whether real or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Or the Wil is as a Mariner, and Intellect the compaſſ by which ſhe ſteers. For the Wils indifferency is but a ſhadow or repreſentativ of that indifferency congeneal to the Intellect; and conſequently the determination of that indifferency in the Miſtriſſ, cauſeth a like determination of indifferency in the Maid, to this or that object. For oftimes our Minds are equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated betwixt two judgments, or waver betwen two objects equaly attractiv: which fluctuation riſeth, becauſ the weights of reaſon are equal on either ſide, that the Mind can acquieſc in the election of neither. Hence three excellent conſequents oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. 1. That ſo oft as the Intellect having embraced tru judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quits it to purſu a falſ one; ſo oft ſomthing intervens, which diverts the genuin appeerance from a good object to an evil one, and ſo cauſeth a mutation of the Intellects aſſent or judgment. 2. That the change of the objects appeerance, is ſole immidiat cauſ of the Intellects varying in judgment and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. 3. That the Wil is hereby obliged to conform to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects guid or conduct; whoſ flexility flows from the others flexibility. So 'tis in vain to attempt a change of the Wils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, til care be had to change the Intellects judgment: Or to make the one conſtant in appetition, unles the other be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in judgment. Thus he of Free-wil in general.</p>
            <p>14. Of Grace and Free-wil jointly, which cooperat in every <note place="margin">14 Grace and Freewil. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</note> ſpiritual work: wherin three Principles or Axioms are to be declared. 1. That in all their operations at our firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in every good work; Grace is ſtil prime principal Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from firſt to laſt: But Mans Wil never works firſt, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; being as a wheel in a Mil, which is kept going by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:168435:57"/> motion, and that ſtaying it ſoon ſtops: So is this kept working by Gods Grace, which flows from his goodnes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our ſalvation. 2. That when Grace works on Mans Underſtanding, Wil, or Affections; it preſervs the natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, properties, and motions of a Reaſonable Creature: for it deſtrois not Nature but helps it; nor doth Nature repel Grace, but receivs it. Though then the habits of Faith, Hope, Charity be infuſed by God, and not acquired by human induſtry; yet are inſpired after the manner of Acquiſits; becauſ inſtilled by means of hearing, praying, meditating, reading, ſtudying, and endeavoring. For ſo ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> not I, but Gods Grace <note place="margin">

That in al operations of Grace, Mans Wil is to rely on God, as the Creature on the Creator; Receiver on the Doner; Weak on the ſtrong; Imperfect on the Perficient; and Supplicant on the Lord: as the Earth depends on Heaven for rain, heat, and influence: which when Man neglects, rejects, or forgets; he is dry, void, and barren of al ſpiritual fruits, by his own fault.</p>
            <p>The imperfect work on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. ſaith, Lo, how appoſitly <note place="margin">Homil. 14.</note> Chriſt ſpeaks: he ſaith not Father ſanctify thy name in us, bring thy Kingdom to us, thy Wil be doon of us; leſt God ſhould ſeem to ſanctify himſelf by Men, or bring his Kingdom on whom he liſts, or make his Wil be doon of whom he pleaſeth; and in that regard be an accepter of perſons: Nor did ſay, Let us ſanctify thy Name, take thy Kingdom, doo thy Wil; leſt it ſhould ſeem to proced from Man only: But he ſpeaks inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly or imperſonaly, <hi>Holowed by thy Name, thy Kingdom com, thy Wil be doon,</hi> to ſhew how needful the work of both is; becauſ Man hath need of God, and he is helpful to Man in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming righteouſnes: For as Man can doo no good without Gods help, ſo he works no good in Man except he be willing: as if he had ſaid, if ye doo theſ things, if ye pray for theſ, ye are worthy of ſuch a Father, who wil giv them.</p>
            <p>To try the truth, take theſ four Propoſitions. 1. Mans Wil, without Grace, can and doth Wil and perform ſpiritual good: this is <hi>Pelagius</hi>'s Hereſy, condemned by the whol Church.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168435:57"/> 2. Mans Wil, without Grace, cannot wil good; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by it, can after, ſans farther Grace, both wil and perform alone: this is the Maſſiliens or Semipelagians error. 3. By or through Gods Grace working on the Wil, it can both wil and doo good; but not without it, nor can continu without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſting Grace: this is truly orthodox, which ſubjoins Mans Wil to Gods Grace in willing and acting good. 4. The Wil, by or through Grace working on it, cannot but wil and perform good: this S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> held in heat of arguing againſt Pelagians and Maſſiliens, who fel too far into the extrem, like ſuch as bow a crooked ſtick back to make it ſtreight, as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> compares. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſerted, that Grace affords ſuch help to the Predeſtinat, as they were not only unable to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without it; but by means of it could not chuſ but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Queſtion (which if rightly put, is like an <note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 16.</note> Oath to end ſtrife) conſiſts about the maner and meaſure, how Grace works on the Wil, or with it? whether the Wil co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operats, as the third Propoſition holds; or whether it ſo works that the Wil muſt needs concur, as the fourth avers? For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining wherof, Grace meant in the third, ſhal be ſtiled effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; that in the fourth (which works neceſſarily or infallibly, cauſing the Wil to conſent) efficacious, Which in tru terms is, whether Grace be reſiſtible, or not? If it be ſo prevalent or <note place="margin">Of reſiſting Grace.</note> prepotent, as it carries the Wil to obey willingly (if that be willing which cannot doo otherwiſe) the fourth is tru: But if Grace be only an efficient, adjuvant, prior Cauſ; and Mans Wil prepared by it, a cooperant ſecund Cauſ in the work of Converſion; which may fail, reſiſt, or diſobey; then the third is more authentic. To prov it for brevity ſake, read <hi>Acts 5. 32. Acts 7. 5. Rom. 10. 16. 2 Cor. 9. 13. Gal. 3. 1. Gal. 5. 7. 2 Theſ.</hi> 5. 8. Al which places are moſt plain, that one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey Goſpel Grace. Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> a ſtif Stickler for effectual Grace, defines thus: We freely confeſſ, that neither operating, nor cooperating Grace, at Converſion or after; doth take off from Mans Wil the power to reſiſt, if it wil: for reſiſtibility is natural born with us, and inſeperable from the Wil, as a nativ faculty: but 'tis not queſtioned ſimply, whether God in the
<pb facs="tcp:168435:58"/> work of Converſion or any other doth mov the Wil reſiſtibly, for that's granted: only the maner of reſiſtibility is in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; wherin we ſay, when God works in the Wil <hi>ipſum Velle</hi> to wil, Grace produceth <hi>non</hi> reſilience, which is effected by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg and prevalence of delight, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith. Therfore we avow actual reſiſtence to be taken away for that time, ſith 'tis impoſſible ſuch ſhould ſtand with effectual Grace: for two oppoſits (the Wil to be wrought on by effectual Grace, and to reſiſt it at once) cannot coexiſt; which were to make the Wil obey and reſiſt at one inſtant. Theſ ſhif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s paſſ current among Partialiſts: but he ſaith al the Controverſy is about the maner or reſiſtibility, which indeed is none at al: for al grant reſiſtibility or power to reſiſt, is not removed by Grace: the Queſtion only is of actual reſiſtence or maner of not reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: wherin none is ſo ſilly to ſay, that when the Wil yeelds actualy to Grace, ther is then any renitence; ſith contingence is not when things are <hi>in Eſſe,</hi> but before they were ſo, whether they might not poſſibly be otherwiſe: that is reſiſt, when it did obey? ſo the debat lies in reſiſtibility before the act of good or evil, not in it: for a Regenerat may ſin reſiſtibly, not in the very moment of willing it; but becauſ he could hav reſiſted yer he willed it. So a Convert obeyeth Grace, or willeth his converſion reſiſtibly; becauſ yer he willed it, he could hav re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: elſ why doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſeriouſly exhort not to reſiſt the Spirit?

               <hi>to make them a new heart and Spirit,</hi> both being evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. So the promiſſ implies or ſuppoſes an impotence in us to doo ſupernatural acts; tendering Gods power, aſſiſtance, and operation to incourage us: but the Precept imports ſom power in us, under his aſſiſting Grace, to indeavor or doo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what toward thoſ acts, which appeer to be ours, becauſ they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our imperfections. Hence we ſtil accuſe our ſelfs, complaining on the weaknes of Faith (Lord, I beleev, help my unbelief) coldnes of lov, pride of heart; yet God givs Faith, Lov, Humility, who is al perfect. Why then doo we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magnify his Goodnes and Graces, if he doth al; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratly diſgrace them, as being impotent or imperfect? ſav only becauſ we hav impaired or made them defectiv by being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Grace.</p>
            <p>Let ſweet <hi>Bernard,</hi> a magnifier of Grace, end this point: Grace ſo operats with Free-wil, as it only prevents in the firſt act, and accompanies in the reſt; but is ſo far preventing, as it even cooperats with Grace; yet ſo, that what is begun by Grace alone, is perfected by both alike: ſo they work jointly, not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraly; together, not by turns in particular degrees: not partly Grace, partly Free-wil; but ech jontly performs the whol. Free-wil doth al, and Grace al; but as the whol is wrought in the Wil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo is it wholy doon by Grace. Thus he; which is the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u ſtate of the whol debate.</p>
            <p>This wil better appear by conſiſtence of Grace and Free-wil in Mans four eſtates. 1. Of Nature ſound. 2. Of Nature lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 3. Of Nature renewed. 4. Of Nature glorified: which ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l be particularly agitated, together with the order of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Converſion.</p>
            <p>Man, at Creation, had to wil or nil naturaly: by ſupernatural Grace to wil more fully, which took not away the natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to nil: by Sin both natural and ſupernatural power to wil wel is loſt; but to nil naturaly remains, and to nil ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly augmented: By preventing Grace to wil is reſtored; to nil both naturaly and ſupernaturaly remaining ſtil: by aſſiſting or
<pb facs="tcp:168435:59"/> recovering Grace both to wil and doo; but to nil naturaly and work contrarily by augmented nilling: by Grace of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wil and doo, more fully augmented; but natural nilling remaining, and augmented nilling diminiſhed: in ſtate of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Man by the beatiſic Viſion wils and doth perfectly, al nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being removed.</p>
            <p>Hence 'tis cleer, how Grace and Free-wil concur or cohere in Nature ſound, depraved, renovated, and glorified: For Man under Nature corrupted without the Law, hath his Mind bound, Wil obſtinat, Life impure, Conſcience ſtupified; being the moſt wretched Son of wrath, yet not knowing his miſery. Man under the Law (as it refers to Grace) acknowledgeth his ſin in Mind, and hath compunction of Conſcience by the ſpirit of fear, being leſſ miſerable becauſ conſcious therof. Man under Grace Caling, preventing, working, learns by the Goſpel the Mercies of the Father, Merits of the Son, Helps of the holy Ghoſt, wherby he conceivs hope of ſalvation; deſiring as a ſick Patient, to be cured, having no power to doo it. Man under Grace of Regeneration being helped wils, willing beleevs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is juſtified and ſaved: whoſ endevors are vain, unles holpen; but being heales, takes up his bed, and the Juſt livs by his Faith. Man, under protecting and perfecting Grace, is joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thankful for it received, watchful over his wais, ſtrong to reſiſt Satan, fighting againſt tentations, fervent in praier, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Faith, and perſevering in holines. Lo, thou art healed; ſin no more, leſt worſ betide thee. Obdurat Sinners (whoſ Freewil reſiſts divine Grace) are of ſeveral ſorts. 1.

Such as receiving hope of ſalvation by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, abuſe the riches of Grace to wantonnes, and d fer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or converſion. 5. Al that being ingrat for Grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and given over to ſecurity or carnal luſts, neglect praier; or ſhaken with fear, deny the Faith; or tempted by Satan, fal
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168435:59"/> into hainous ſins: who are in danger of damnation, unles they <note place="margin">Ezek 18, 26, 27</note> return to God by a new act of Faith and Repentance to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by him. In every of which degrees, Gods ſeverity hath juſt occaſion to deſert Man, and not proced to procure his converſion, or aſſiſt his Wil; but if he doth, 'tis of ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace.</p>
            <p>Here ſom doubts occur concerning Caling or Converſion, what part a ſinner to be converted bears in it? Whether he is activ or paſſiv, and how far? Whether he can further or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? Who puts the difference, God or Man? To theſ it is briefly anſwered: 1. That he is paſſiv, in having the Law and Goſpel preached to him; but activ in hearing or attending. 2. That he is paſſiv in receiving impreſſions of fear by the Law, and hope by the Goſpel; but activ in nouriſhing them, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working with Grace, or caſhiring them from his heart by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying. 3. He is paſſiv in admitting good thoughts, holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, &amp; power to wil; but activ in ruminating on thoſ thoughts, cheriſhing ſuch deſires, and endevoring to exerciſe that power offred by Grace to aſſiſt his Wil. 4. He is ſtil paſſiv in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet a willing Patient, thirſting after Repentance, Lov, or what elſ he prais for; but activ by help in producing of the acts therof, out of thoſ gifts and habits infuſed into him. 5. He is both paſſiv under Gods power protecting him, being a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver converted; and activ in watching over himſelf, with Gods Grace concurring to guard and defend him.</p>

For ther is infinit variety in moſt, yet God indifferent to al, and damns none but by their own default.</p>
            <p>Touching thankfulnes, Grace is not therfore Grace, becauſ given to one and denied to another; but becauſ 'tis given to the unworthy (for it were not leſſs, but greater if extended to al) ſo that my thanks are du to God, becauſ he had mercy on me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; not becauſ he ſhews more mercy to me then others: Nor are my thanks the leſſ, becauſ many mo partake with me in the benefits; but ſhould rather be greater, if millions mo were partakers then be.</p>

               <hi>Salvianus</hi> ſaith men ow a general debt for Chriſts paſſion, and al Mankind ſans exception bound therto: yet none ows the leſſ, becauſ others ow the like: For though the debt be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet 'tis ſpecial too, and every particular equaly ingaged: ſith as Chriſt ſuffered for al, ſo he did for ech; and beſtowed
<pb facs="tcp:168435:61"/> himſelf on al, as he did on every one: wholy for al and wholy for ech individual. In which regard as al ow themſelfs wholy to him for it, ſo doth every one wholy; ſav that ech ows more then al Mankind, becauſ he reaps ſo much benefit as al Men. This is a good rule, but beware of the Phariſees comparativ form of thanks, too rife now adais: <hi>Lord, I thank thee I am not as other Men.</hi> Indeed as ſom put the Caſe of Mankind like a cru of Rebels, of whom the King pardons ſuch as he liſts, and executs the reſt, thoſ pardoned ow more thanks. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtates it thus: God mercifully proclaims a general Goſpel pardon to al Rebels, on condition that he which ſubmits and yeelds his Sword, taking a Ticket of his pardon, ſhal go ſafe; but ſuch as refuſe or ſtand out ſhal be deſtroied. Such as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, magnify his Mercy and griev for their Felows obſtinacy, juſtifying the execution doon on them. Thoſ that in the firſt way amplify Gods Grace for ſparing ſom ſimply, prejudice his Truth proclaimed to al: But ſuch as advance his Grace for ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring al on fair, facil, feaſible conditions exhibited in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; ſet his Favor forth, Mercy, and Truth much more. It may more literaly be laid thus. If a King having al his Subjects in his power and pleaſure to deſtroy for Rebellion, ſhal publicly proclaim pardon to al that wil ſubmit to his Son, on ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as they ſhal be able by his gracious aſſiſtance and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to perform; knowing that ſom wil tractably obey, but the reſt perſiſt obſtinat or obdurat in their Crimes: he then is bound by promiſſ or Covenant to pardon the penitent; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvs to puniſh the reſt according to their deſerts.</p>
            <p>Here both his Mercy and Juſtice is equaly or eminently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to al, without reſpect of perſons: but the difference conſiſts in the new obedience of one ſort, and old obſtinacy of the other: yet doth not the Cauſ depend on the effect (as ſom fondly object or cavil) but the Monarch, according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Proclamation freely pardons the penitent, and juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrois the impenitent.</p>
            <p>As to glorying that one doth more then another; Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord, or not glory: for Gods Gifts are duple. 1. Immediat from himſelf ſoly (as Toungs, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Prophecying) of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>What hast thou which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168435:61"/> thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received, why boaſteſt thou?</hi> 2. Mediat, which proced from Gods Grace and Mans Wil jointly (as Faith, Repentance, Obedience) being both Gods gifts wrought by Grace; therfore no glorying but in the Lord, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: and duties owing by us upon peril of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10.

To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv as a Gift not only excluds glory, but includs duty: for in doing al which is commanded, we doo but our duty being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>doth the Maſter thank his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 9.</note> 
               <hi>becauſ he did what was bid? I trow not.</hi> Yet we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with S. <hi>Paul, in the teſtimony of a good conſcience;</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12. 1 Sam. 12. 13 Neh. 5. 15.</note> cald witnes of his integrity; and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> recorded his own ſincerity. Howbeit whatever our natural parts be, or labor and induſtry beyond others, or how proſperouſly ſoever it ſucceds; who is ſo void of piety as not to aſcribe it to the fountain of al good? God builds the houſ more then al Laborers, keeps the City abov al Warders, givs more increaſ then al Planters or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; yet Builders, Warders, Planters, Waterers hav al ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat Offices, which being neglected the Houſ is unbuilded, City unguarded, and Plant unmanured: Becauſ God doth moſt in converting, and Man nothing in compariſon, but al by him; the Saints may rejoyce and ſay, not unto us Lord, not to us; but to thy name giv the glory. Yet (not unto us) implies ſomthing to be doon by us, whereof we muſt not glory, being our duty.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould thoſ poor things of Mans Wil (to wiſh or wil, labor, endevor, yeeld or obey) be once named when Gods Grace is praiſed or works pleaded: yet ſomtimes a neceſſity compels therto. For Men, under color of piety, to magnifiy Gods Grace and reprov Natures Paraſits, becom diſparagers of Free-wil and Flatterers of Grace; wherby Satan ſeeks to ſubvert Gods truth and righteouſnes, deſtroying tru Piety and Religion in Men; by bringing a ſtupid ſloth on ſom, a remorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſ infidelity or impenitence on others, and an invincible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation or obduration in moſt; which is the genuin Of-ſpring
<pb facs="tcp:168435:62"/> of that Doctrin, which deprivs Mans Wil of al freedom in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation, by turning the Goſpels general promiſes into particular limitings of ſpecial Grace, effectual only to a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ones by direct abſolut Decree; leaving the reſt forlorn or deſtitut of tru Grace, though caled by the ſame word of the Goſpel.</p>

               <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſpeaks herof before <hi>Arminius</hi> was ever heard of: <note place="margin">Loc commun. de Praedeſt.</note> Let us remov from S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuch Stoical diſputs as deſtroy Faith &amp; Prayer: for how could <hi>Saul</hi> beleev or pray, when he doubted whether the Promiſſ belonged to him, or when the fatal Table of Deſtinies had prepoſſeſled him? for 'tis decreed thou ſhalt be a Caſtaway. If Free-wil avail nothing, til I perceiv Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration wrought in me by the Spirit; I wil be indulgent to my ſelf-unbeleef and other vitious affections of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>This Manichean imagination is flat falſhood, and our minds are to be drawn from it, and taught that Free-wil with Grace avails much. Thus he, who alſo in point of diſcrimination ſaith: When Promiſes are univerſal, and no contrary or contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wils in God; ther muſt needs be ſom cauſ of difference in us: as why <hi>Saul</hi> was rejected and <hi>David</hi> received, ſom diſparity in thoſ two cauſed it: yet ſtil remember that the doing ſom good or il action, is not to be conceived to be by meer natural ſtrength of Wil, but as 'tis helped by divine Grace: beware leſt in ſhunning <hi>Scilla</hi> thou fal not on <hi>Charybdis.</hi>

            <p>15. Regeneration is caled by ſom the firſt Reſurrection, and <note place="margin">15 Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Converſion a new Creation: who aſſert that Man doth no more to his new Creation then he did at firſt; nor to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation then Generation; nor to his Reſurrection from ſin then <hi>Lazarus</hi> did in raiſing his dead body. Hence <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith, that the ſeed of ſpiritual life, and habits of Faith and Grace, are infuſed like a new Soul, before Men be ſupernaturaly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſith illumination goes before the act (not habit) of Faith and ſanctifying Grace in the Soul. So Mr. <hi>Tailor</hi> on S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words (<hi>whoever is in Chriſt, is a new Creature</hi>) infers that Grace cannot be reſiſted, becauſ no Creature can reſiſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in framing him. Such dangerous dogmats thei grand Rabbies inſtil into their credulous Diſciples. This ſavours too much of Enthuſiaſm, and in our ſpiritual Nativity as in the Natural, are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168435:62"/> many preparatory diſpoſitions, not al by infuſion: nor are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from Allegories (which is too rife among Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſts) authentic, if extended beyond Scriptures tru ſenſ. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words (<hi>if any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature</hi>) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> are not ſtrictly to be ſenſed; for new Creation is meant of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, not ſubſtance: elſ if literaly preſſed, a kind of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation in Mans Converſion may be better maintained, then Papiſts doo of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds it wel; That new birth is not the ſubſtance, but dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Grace: for it intimats the univerſality of this change in qualities to be ſo diffuſed over the whol Man, as one ſhal not know him to be the ſame: whence 'tis more bluntly caled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, to ſhew the great mutation or variation. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes the old and new Man by alteration of quality: <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 9. 10. Gal. 5 6. 1 Cor. 7. 19.</note> 'tis <hi>faith working by lov</hi> which makes a new Creature, and to keep Gods Commandments.

<pb facs="tcp:168435:63"/> Faction: for thoſ things which in ſuch a Man pleaſed to day; if he turned to morow another way, were diſliked: and what was commended yeſterday, ſhal be condemned to day. How wel this agrees with our age (indeed with al times ſince <hi>Adam</hi>) let the world judg and apply as they liſt.</p>
            <p>Under <hi>Henry</hi> 8. was a Book publiſhed by the Clergy (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">An. Reg. 35. A. C. 1543.</note> Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was chief) and confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtiled <hi>A neceſſary Erudition for a Chriſtian:</hi> wherin Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil is declared to remain in Man after <hi>Adams</hi> fal, as theſ Texts teſtify; <hi>Be not overcom of Evil: Neglect not the Grace in thee: Lov not the World: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> al which doubtleſſ were in vain, if Man had no power or faculty, with help of Grace, to underſtand the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and freely obey them: but it wils not any good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, unles holpen by Grace; willing what is il of it ſelf. Hence ſom Divines define it to be a power of Reaſon and Wil, by which Good is choſen w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th aſſiſtance of Grace, or Evil without it. Next it ſhews the diſparity between our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toparents Free wil to obey or diſobey, and their Poſterities; which is prone only to Evil, unles illumined and made free by ſpecial Grace, or ſupernatural working of the Holy Ghoſt: which Gods goodnes offers to al; yet they only enjoy it, who by Freewil accept the ſame. Nor can they, being ſo holpen, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh or perform things for their ſaving health, but with much labor and endevor: For though Reaſons light remains, yet 'tis much dimmed or darkned, and hardly diſcerns inferior things of this life; but utterly unable to underſtand ſpiritual belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a better. So though ther is left a freedom of Wil in works of this preſent life; yet to act high and Heavenly, 'tis of it ſelf inſufficient, and being wounded or maimed, needs help <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 18.</note> to heal and repair it. Hereto <hi>David</hi> reflected, <hi>Open thou my eys, that I may ſee the wondrous things of thy Law:</hi> and <hi>Jeremy, Heal me, Lord, and I ſhal be made whol.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> avers the ſame, That Free-wil is in Man ſince the Fal, which no Catholic can deny: But in ſpiritual deſires and works to pleaſ God, 'tis ſo frail and feeble, that it cannot begin or perform them, unles it be prevented and excited by Grace the principal Agent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Man can doo nothing good or Godly, as theſ places

               <hi>the Father draw him, and unles it were given of my Father: We be not ſufficient of our ſelfs to think any good.</hi> So Free-wil muſt be helped by Grace preventing, but being ſo enabled may freely cooperat with it; and being by the ſame ſuſteined, may perſiſt or increaſ in Grace. Surely 'tis ſoly by it, that we be firſt inſpired, incited, or moved to good: But to reſiſt tentations and go forward in goodnes; is both of Gods Grace and our own Free-wil jointly. Laſtly, when we hav perſevered to the end, 'tis Gods free gift and Mercy to Crown us with glory, who hath graciouſly ordained to reward Men after this life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good works doon by his Grace. Therfore al are to be moniſhed (chiefly Preachers) that in this deep dark point, they neither ſo teach Gods Grace as to exclud Free-wil; nor extol Free-wil to impeach Grace. Thus they very orthodoxly. Here is no Free-wil to ſpiritual good without Grace, nor Grace ſo prepotent or violent but may be reſiſted or refuſed: yet enough to glorify Gods goodnes, and convince Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitud. Al which is ſound Theology, and ſhews that they were learned in thoſ dais.</p>
            <p>16. Perſeverance or Aſſurance to the end, is Gods ſpecial <note place="margin">16 Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> gift or Grace; becauſ no Man of himſelf alone can continu againſt al aſſalts of the World, Fleſh, and Satan: yet no doubt the Elect doo finaly perſiſt in Faith and Sanctification by Grace; elſ they are not of that number, whom God infallibly foreknew wil ſo perſever. Nor is the Queſtion whether every Beleever may loſe his faith; for many fal from ſom degrees, and not loſe al Graces at once, retaining only ſuch as be eſſentialy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation? but 'tis whether tru Faith working by Lov, can be loſt? for ther is a ſtrong, vigorous, rooted Faith, which cannot fal or fail: and a feeble, green, tender (yet tru ſalvific) which may. Such was <hi>Peters,</hi> which a ſilly Damoſel ſhattered: but after the Holy Ghoſt given at Pentecoſt, his Faith and Lov were ſo corroborated, as he deſpiſed the Whips and wounds of al Perſecutors; yea death it ſelf by prepoſterous crucifixion of his heels upward.</p>
            <p>Hence two Queſtions ariſe: 1. Of Men not Elected, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſom ſuch doo not attain tru Faith, Repentance, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:168435:64"/> Sanctification; yet loſe them, and not finaly perſever, but periſh? 2. Of the Elect, Whether ſom of thoſe doo not ſomtimes fal into hainous ſins (Theft, Adultery, Murder) and if ſo, whether they be then juſtified or in ſtate of Salvation? For perſeverance is of two ſorts or degrees: either continued by conſtant holding Faith and a good Conſcience to the end, which is rare: or interrupted with fals and riſings, or renewings by Repentance, which brings Salvation at laſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt which are not Elect, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He that endures to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the end ſhal be ſaved.</hi> Here he that hath Salvation promiſed, if he perſiſt finaly, is ſuppoſed to be in a right courſ wherin he ſhould continu, and ſo be ſaved: but it implies that he may poſſibly fal from Faith, or wax cold in Lov, and not be ſaved. Herof S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, falendued with Lov had perſevered, our Lord in vain exhorts his Diſciples to continu therin: for if they did not yet Lov, he would not ſay continu, but be in Lov: or if they did Lov already, he needed not exhort to perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, according to ſom Opinions: Elſ wher he ſaith, ſuch hav no root, who for a while beleev, but in time of tentation fal away. Whence or whether doo they fal? even from faith to unbeleef. I ask, could they be ſaved in that Faith, or not? If they could not, what prejudice had our Saviour, or Satan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their faling away? S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, If every one born of God cannot ſin nor be tempted, why doth Chriſt warn us to fly tentation? Som ſay ſuch Exhortations, Precepts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are uſed to uphold Perſeverance: But if it be infallible, they are uſed in vain; unles obedience to them be in Man, who failing on his part, thoſ means often fail. <hi>David</hi> knew the two Commandments, as means to reſtrain his two ſins; but they failed through him. <hi>Peters</hi> forewarning of his denial was a means to humble his confidence, but he made no uſe of it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, In regard of our weaknes we may fal, and means muſt be uſed for ſupport: but by Gods Election, and Chriſts Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, we ſhal ſtand ſure.

            <p>The <hi>Dort</hi> Divines anſwer not this place, being too hard a knot: but ſay to others, that the Apoſtles ſpeak of initial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Faith, from which Men a little entred may go back: But not of tru juſtifying, from which they that hav attained cannot finaly fal.

               <note place="margin">De Cor. &amp; Gr. c. 6.</note> leſſer lapſes ordinary. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, 'Tis much to be marveled, why God givs not perſeverance to ſom of his Children whom he regenerated in Chriſt, and gav Faith, Hope, Lov; when he forgivs ſo great wickedneſſes to others, and confers the grace of Sons on them: he wonders why God did not ſnatch ſuch away as lived Godly from the evil to com, leſt their il inclinations ſhould cauſ a change. So he holds, if thoſ Men had dyed while they lived juſtly and piouſly, they had been ſaved: <hi>Ergo</hi> their Faith was more then initiated, and they more then outſide Chriſtians. As God firſt cals Man before he folows; ſo Man firſt fals from God before he forſakes, who is ſtil ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv al into Grace upon tru repentance. So ſaith our ſixteenth Article: After we hav received the Holy Ghoſt we may depart from Grace and fal into ſin, and by Gods Grace riſe again and amend our lifes. Therfore they are to be condemned which ſay they can no more ſin ſo long as they liv here, or deny to tru Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents place of forgivnes.</p>
            <p>Touching the terms of faling totaly and finaly, it is certain only to Gods Preſcience, but unknown to us: for the Faithful may fal, and God alone knows, whether they wil repent or riſe again; but we muſt ſtil work with fear and trembling. If they cannot fal, why doth Chriſt bid us pray, <hi>Lead us not into tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but deliver us from evil?</hi> or why doth our Liturgy ſay, <hi>Suffer us not at laſt hour for any pains of death to fal from thee?</hi> For the Elect thoſ of <hi>Dort</hi> grant, that a Regenerat faling into grievous ſins, is not actualy reconciled til he repent; but in ſtate of damnation, and unapt to enter into Gods Kingdom: but they ad, 1. Though the Regenerats ſo ſinning be guilty; yet they ſhal be in Gods purpoſ abſolved: Tru, So they were before they beleeved. 2. That God deals not with them in rigour: No more doth he with many Reprobats falen from Faith, whom he would bring to repentance by long ſuffering. 3. That they hav not loſt <hi>Jus ad Regnum,</hi> but <hi>uſum Juris:</hi> as a Lepet loſeth the uſe of his houſ, not right: But ſimilituds are no ſound Arguments. Hath an Elect committing murder <hi>jus ad Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num?</hi> then S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks falſ: <hi>I tel you, they that doo ſuch</hi>

               <hi>things, ſhal not inherit Gods Kingdom,</hi> but al that hav right <note place="margin">James 2 10.</note> ſhal inherit. 4. That their univerſal Juſtification is not made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168435:65"/> void by ſinning: ſurely their abſolution from former ſins is not fruſtrated; but this new ſin which makes them Sons of wrath and <hi>guilty of the whol Law,</hi> needs Abſolution and Juſtification from it: But univerſal Juſtification is no remiſſion of ſins paſt, preſent, and to com: For what need then Repentance? 5. That their ſtate of Adoption remains immovable: Tru, In Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ, not in act; but that they may fal. 6. That ſom ſeeds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, by which Life may ſpring again: It may for ſooner then in an habituated Sinner; Yet this alters not the Caſe, if he be guilty of death, no more then a Noblemans crime, who hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends to beg his life. S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoever is born of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 3 9.</note> 
               <hi>commits not ſin; for his ſeed remains, and he cannot ſin becauſ born of God.</hi> Hence <hi>Calviniſts</hi> infer, if Gods ſeed remain in a Regenerat and he cannot ſin (deadly) then can be no interciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Juſtification. Certes, his ſcope is not to prov, that thoſ born of God cannot fal from righteouſnes to ſin, or that a Member of Chriſt cannot becom the member of an Harlot by Adultery; and he that hath bin the member of an Harlot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the Member of Chriſt by Repentance: But he means, that to be born of God and commit deadly ſin cannot conſiſt; nor can any be a Member of Chriſt and an Harlot at once being Aſyſtats.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Jerom</hi> writing againſt <hi>Jovinian</hi> (who abuſed this Text, as Men doo now) interprets thus: S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is born of God commits not ſin, becauſ ye ſhould not ſin;</hi> not that ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; but ſo long as ye commit not ſin, ye are Gods Children: yea ſuch as perſiſt his Sons cannot ſin. For ther is firſt a faling from God, before we fal into ſin, ſith thoſ two cannot cohere. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels how ſom ſay, They hav God ſure enough in Heart and Mind, yet ſhew no ſign in their actions, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, thinking their fear and Faith ſafe: as if they committed Adultery, yet deemed their chaſtity not impaired; or poiſoned their Parents, thinking to doo God good ſervice. Thus while they continu in ſin, notwithſtanding their fear; they ſhal be caſt into Hel, notwithſtanding their Faith. Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John</hi> means, He cannot ſin ſo long as Gods ſeed abides in him; but Faith, Hope and Charity cannot ſtand with evil living, nor without good Works. <hi>David,</hi> while he ſtood guilty of a
<pb facs="tcp:168435:66"/> duple crime, could not be in ſtate of Regeneration; nor <hi>Peter,</hi> til he repented his denial: Yet ſom ſay it was <hi>ſalvo amore &amp; fide;</hi> becauſ as we are born but once, ſo we are new born no oftner. This metaphor holds not; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Litle Children, of whom I travel in birth again, til Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo oft as we fal into hainous ſins, we muſt ſtil be renewed by Repentance: but Men wil expound Scripture as they liſt.</p>
            <p>As to the certainty of Perſeverance, Election, Salvation; this concerns not God, whoſ knowledg is infallible, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ immutable; but us, while we liv here. For deciding or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining wherof, weigh theſ three concluſions: 1. That a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, being in preſent ſtate and uſe of holy means, tending to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and out of tentation in the peace of a good Conſcience through Faith in Chriſt; may, by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, hav a comfortable aſſurance of Salvation, which begets truſty fervent lov and thankfulnes to God: ſpecialy when he is neer the end of his race or point of death. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſaith, <hi>I am now ready to be offred up: I hav ſought a good</hi>

               <hi>fight, finiſhed my courſ, and kept the Faith: Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſnes.</hi> This place Lutherans preſſ againſt Papiſts, who wil hav al by doubting, and none certain of his preſent condition, no not at beſt: But he that hath right knowledg of God, tru Faith, ſtedfaſt Hope, lifely Lov, and awful Filial fear, with an holy trade of Life; he may rejoyce in God, with comfortable confidenre and affiance of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the end. 2. That for time to com (ſpecialy when we hav probably a long race to run, and diverſ dangers of wild wonton Youth to paſſ) we cannot hav infallible certitud of future or final perſevering; but muſt confide in Gods Grace <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> and Goodnes, that he wil aſſiſt, if we apply al our indevors to <note place="margin">De Civ c. 11. 12</note> continu in it. Hereof S. <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeaks, We cal them bleſſed whom we ſee liv wel with hope of future immortality, and without ſuch crimes as make ſhipwrack of Conſcience: who, though they may rely on the reward of Pe ſeverance; yet are not ſure of perſevering. For who knows certainly he ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu in doing righteouſnes to the end, except he be aſſured by ſom revelation from him, who is not pleaſed in his juſt ſecret
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168435:66"/> judgment to inform al touching this point, though he deceivs none? S. <hi>Ambroſ</hi> thus: <hi>David</hi> ſaith not, I offer the ſacrifice <note place="margin">De bono mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That certitud of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be infallible in this life, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> atteſts: What <note place="margin">De Cor. &amp; Gr. 13.</note> Beleever, ſo long as he livs in this fleſhly Tabernacle, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum to be predeſtinat? 'tis needful to be conceled in this life, wher puffing up is to be ſhunned; ſith ſo great an Apoſtle was buffeted by Satan, leſt he ſhould be puf'd up. Many ſuch things are ſpoken for the uſefulnes of this ſecret, leſt any ſhal preſume: for even he that runs wel may fear, ſith 'tis hid whither he ſhal go.</p>
            <p>Much more he vents to the ſame effect: For Gods Promiſes in Chriſt are certain, but made with conditions; ſo that we may miſſ of the end, if we fail in the means to fulfil our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; ſith no Man ſhal be crowned til he fight it out and the battel ended; triumph not before the victory. Gods Decrees are known ſoly to himſelf, but ſecret to us, who muſt rely on the Promiſſes by performing the Covenants. If we may be fully aſſured of tru Faith, that it cannot fail, but we ſhal infallibly perſever to the end, through al frailties and tentations; then Gods Counſil is not ſecret to ſom, nor his Decree unknown: which is high preſumption to arrogat or affirm; ſith we muſt ſtil <hi>work it out with fear and trembling.</hi> This is a Cavaliers Creed or confidence in the point of final perſeverance, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations

               <hi>Ob.</hi> Som oppoſits object, that <hi>Adam</hi> haply had ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Free-wil; but by his Fal that abſolut liberty to al things is leſſened, and to Spirituals loſt: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis granted, but with Proviſo, That God foreſeing this fal and loſſ, with intent not to prevent it, prepared ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Graces of his powerful Spirit, to repair or reſtore what was decaied, by giving a new Command or Covenant, fit for Mans infirm wounded Wil; and thoſ Graces of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which he would be ſtil ready to ſupply by preventing, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, protecting, and preſerving, if he be not wanting to his duty: For Gods Wiſdom is not ſo weak to make ſuch a noble Creature only for ſhew to Angels, or to ſet him in the World for a day or two, and baniſh him for ever into Hel fire, under the ſlavery and tyranny of Rebellious Fiends, of his own free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, without foreſight of any deſerts good or evil; which is the Manichees error, horrid to conceiv of ſo gracious a God, who created him purpoſly to be the ſubject of his righteous Judgment.

We muſt ſo defend the one, as not deſtroy the other, which wil wel conſiſt together.</p>
            <p>Hence it folows, That a juſt Decree before al time what ſhal be doon to every one at end of time; cannot poſſibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be made but by Gods ſimple Preſcience of every Mans works, rendring to ech accordingly. Now becauſ that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſeth from a Soveraign Lord of abſolut Wil, who wil be Debtor to none, but al to him; it folows alſo that this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg on which the Decree is founded, muſt needs be (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

The diſput is not of predeſtinating al things that are and rejecting the reſt; but only of Angels and Men: in what maner or order ſom were ordained to life, and al elſ repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated? this proceds from Gods ſimple knowledg which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceds Predeſtination; not from that of Viſion or ſight (which is of things that either hav had or ſhal hav being) which folows and is founded on it. By this God underſtood if he would endu ſom Creatures with Reaſon and a free Nature; 1. He ſhould beſt ſhew forth in them his Wiſdom, goodnes, mercy, juſtice, fidelity, and al his ſublime properties: 2. That ſuch Creatures wil vary in their choices; ſom cleaving to good, ſom to evil (as Men are moraly virtuous or vitious) which he foreſaw not only in general, but every particular perſon if created and put to trial: yet it reſted in his free pleaſure, to creat and try, or hinder their choices. 3. That of ſuch whom he knew would prevaricat if permitted free, he might juſtly puniſh them for diſobeying; or could fit means to reſtore and reconcile them, yet decreed neither. 4. He conceived it juſter or equitabler to puniſh rebellious Angels being created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual and moſt intellectual; but to ſpare Men in mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to multiply their kind and made more frail; ſpecialy if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſubtle Spirits. 5. He foreknew if he ſhould ordain ſufficient means to raiſ al Men lapſed; that ſom would grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiv his bounty to their ſalvation, and others wilfully or ingratly reject it for the pleaſure of ſin to their perdition: holding ſtil the determination what to doo or permit in his ful power. 6. He knew if he ſhould condemn the contumacious, and favor ſuch as returned to him; he ſhould deal juſtly with the one, mercifully with the other, and judg al righteouſly.
<pb facs="tcp:168435:70"/> Al theſ things with every circumſtance (as they are in being from beginning of the World to the end) God underſtood as under condition or ſuppoſition, it he ſhould pleaſ to put them in execution: which after du deep deliberation in his eternal counſil (to ſpeak ſtil after our ſhalow apprehenſion) his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wil and Wiſdom was to pronounce this mighty Word or Decree, <hi>Fiant,</hi> let them be.

From the firſt acception ariſe 2. Queſtions. 1. Whether this term of Life circumſcribed by a natural deflux of the Body (which is a kind of mature facil faling away of Natures ligaments, like ripe Apples, be definitly fixd by divine Ordinance to leav every in dividual in his own moderation, without preſcribing or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that this decay of temperature ſhould hav more or leſſ du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then what may naturaly occur from the more or leſſ du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability therof? 2. If Life be thus fixd by Gods decree not to prolong it beyond the point of its natural durability; whether he can without altering his own eſtabliſhed courſ of Nature, being moved by Mens praiers or pitty (as he added 15 yeers to <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> dais) correct thoſ depravities procured by exceſſ, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or other extraneous means, and ſo hinder the diſſolution therof? That is, whether if God hath predetermined that none ſhal exced the term, to which the durability of his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual temper or ſtrength of conſtitution may probably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; his ſpecial Providence doth not permit, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament may be vitiated, impaired, or ruined by putrefactiv deſtructiv preternatural cauſes obvenient, and ſo not hold out to that point of time, which otherwiſe by its primigeneous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv condition it might hav reached unto: For the ſecund ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Life in general by what means of diſſolution ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:168435:71"/> (ſicknes, ſurfeit, ſhipwrack, ſuffocation, famin, war, wounds, or other-wais) this queſtion occurs, whether the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>natural period therof be ſo preciſely prefixd; that no Human prudence or providence can prevent or prolong it, nor fortuitous accidents accelerat or prevert it? In brief, whether the Cataſtrophe of ech Mans life be prefined in the Book of Fate or Divine Decree? Life is ſaid to be fixd in a duple ſenſ: 1. In reſpect of ſom abſolut Decree antegredient to Gods Preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ience of al ſecund inſtrumental cauſes; ſo that Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly prorogue it beyond, or fal ſhort of that fatal term. 2. In reſpect of ſom conditionat Hypothetic Decree; whoſ alteration or accompliſhment is ſuperſeded by the electiv li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mans Wil, either as guided by ſupernatural light of divine Grace to purſu the real tru good; or ſeduced by deluſion of its own ſenſual judgment, to wander in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious tracts of error, and ſo chuſ ſeeming falſ Good. Now it skils not, whether this conditionat Decree be grounded on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prenotion of al concomitant circumſtances and corollary relations, concerning Mans election of adhering to good and evil Objects; and his conſequent virtuous or vicious courſ of life? Or whether it be made without any ſuch infallible preno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or volition, yet with a poſitiv deliberat ſentence certainly to be executed in du time, when the right uſe or abuſe of Freewil ſhal be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſe 3. Opinions: 1. Som hold the term of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">1 Opinion.</note> very Mans life, with al cauſes and clauſes conducing to be flatly fatal or immovable, by Gods irreſiſtible Wil and Decree; according to the vulgar ſaying, his time is com; this is a Stoical deviſe uſed as a ſpur to excite magnanimous ſpirits againſt dangers of death, that every Mans deſtiny is writ with inviſible indeleble characters in his forhead: which al Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans maintain doctrinaly, and many Chriſtians igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.</p>
            <p>But 'tis in it ſelf impious if not blaſphemous; to confine <note place="margin">Confut.</note> Gods chief attribut of infinit Omnipotence, within the definit liſts, laws, or limits of ſecund cauſes: and it derogats from the liberty of Mans wil, leaving nothing in his power to elect or eſchew, nor to act or ſhun.

Hownbeit Man doth not any thing in time becauſ God foreknew it: but contrarily becauſ Man wil doo this or that in time, therfore God eternaly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew it would ſo com to paſſ. 2.

So he deals with al obſtinat obdurant ſinners, who firſt refuſe or reſiſt Grace offred, nor wil uſe the means preſcribed: but how far he uſeth Preſcience in al theſ works, he ſelf only knoweth. The ſimilitud of the Potter ſheweth, that none hath cauſ to conteſt or complain againſt God; ſith every one by lapſed Nature is liable to condemnation, and 'tis his meer mercy to ſav any. The elect are caled veſſels of honor and mercy, but Reprobats of diſhonor, wrath, and fury: both which preſuppoſe ſin, ſpecialy diſobedience and impenitence in theſ, whom God endured with long ſuffering (as he did the wicked of the old World) but being deſpiſed, ſhewed his wrath and power on them. The ſalvation of al that are ſaved, and perdition of al which periſh, is rightly referred to his Wil as ſuprem univerſal cauſ, mover, diſpoſer and Governor of al; who could hav ordered them otherwiſe if he pleaſed: yet muſt this chief Agent be conſidered, not as doing al by himſef alone; but ſuffering other created Natures to uſe their free faculties, as his Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy, Dominion ſhal judg fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them holily and righteouſly after his own Nature.</p>
            <p>Thus he prepared ſom to life, ſom to death, as their ſeveral ends; but by intervent of their own acts foreſeen ſo wel as his; who proceds in his purpoſes ſo blameleſly, as a Potter in making of the ſame Clay ſom Veſſels for better, and ſom for baſer uſes or ſervices. For though there be much neernes between the Potter and his Clay to diſpoſe at his pleaſure; yet is much more betwen God and his Creatures. So whom he choſe in Chriſt and willed to ſav by him (ſuppoſing his own acts of giving his Spirit to them, and their readines to receiv and obey) ſuch are Veſſels made to honor: But thoſ whom he rejected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to deſtruction (upon like ſuppoſal of their acts, in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Promiſes and abuſing his Graces) ſuch are Veſſels made to diſhonour and damnation: For ſuch ſuppoſals are neceſſary here, ſith Mankind is not like a lump of Clay, ſenſleſſ and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſ; but a free Intelligent Creature, made to work or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own ends both good and evil: good by working with
<pb facs="tcp:168435:74"/> God, who ſeeks Mans good; or evil, by forſaking and faling from him in this work: But becauſ God could hav altered or amended his whol maſſ or any parcel, which the Potter perhaps cannot alwais doo in his; therfore he hath a far nobler power over Mankind then a Potter of his Clay to make Veſſels of honor or diſhonour: wherby al is reſolved to his Wil, as the prime ſuprem Cauſ, which allows al ſubordinats to work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Natures, and applies them to his own glory: Nor doth the Potter deſtroy or caſt away his veſſels; no more wil God his Creatures ſans cauſ.</p>

Calvinians diſtinguiſh betwixt the Entity of every act which is good from God; and Obliquity which is evil from Man: inſtancing in a bias Bowl and halting Horſ, whoſ deviations proced not from the Caſter or Rider. The Lutherans ſay ſuch diſtinctions and compariſons are poor palliations, like Cobwebs to catch ſilly Flies and partial folowers. For God decrees no evil (either Entity or Obliquity) but only foreſaw al in his pure Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and determined in his ſecret counſil to permit it only. For Decree is the act of his ſoveraign wil which no creature can reſiſt at any time: but he offers ſufficient Grace indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to al, which may be refuſed or reſiſted by any, and is by too many; who hav Freewil on the left hand to evil, as al ſides unanimouſly agree. Som ſay Grace flows from God by two Fountains of Purpoſ and Preaching: but that of Purpoſ flows alſo from Preaching: for Faith cometh by hearing. S. <hi>Paul</hi> reconciles both, making Gods foreknowledg the firſt link
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168435:74"/> which leads al: for though his general lov be the ſole ſource, whence Preaching, Caling and promiſſ of Grace proceds even to the Elect; whoſ caling he chiefly intended, as if he ſent his Word only to them: yet publiſhed it to the reſt alſo, that his goodnes to al may be manifeſted. So Preaching is the Fountain of conveying Grace to them that receiv it, and might be to the reſt which reject it; ſith Gods purpoſ from Preſcience, is the Fountain of Grace to ſuch as hav it; but thoſ who hav it not (to whom alſo the Word is preached) want it by their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain or diſobedience foreknown; not for default of divine Predeſtination. For <hi>Quos praeſcivit</hi> preceds <hi>praedeſtinavit,</hi> as <hi>Quos praedeſtinavit</hi> doth <hi>vocavit, juſtificavit, &amp; glorificavit,</hi> which are the ſucceſſiv links of that Heavenly golden Chain leading to life everlaſting.</p>

Again, That Gods power predeſtinats any to evil ſo as he cannot be good; we doo not only not beleev ſo great an evil, but with al deteſtation denounce ſuch accurſed. So did the Arauſican Council.

At <hi>Hague</hi> Conference, the Contra-Remonſtrants would not condeſcend to argu this point with the Arminian Remonſtrants, but reſolved rather to break off then begin it. At <hi>Dort</hi> Synod, the Preſident warned the Remonſtrants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat the point of Election, but not touch the harſh ſtring of Reprobation; yet both are parts of Predeſtination, the wel or il ſtating wherof, doth much concern Gods glory and good of Religion: Nor can one be rightly handled without the other, ſpecialy ſith al uprores then roſe about Reprobation; which doctrin was deeply chalenged of error, and bound to be cleered. Nor was it to be diſcuſſed among the ſimpler ſort, who might haply ſtumble at it, but by profound learned Men, who as threſhing Oxen were to beat out the Corn, and bolt out truth couched in the bare letter of Scripture. <hi>Vives</hi> ſaith, Tru Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not gilded, but gold it ſelf; which being ſcraped ſhews the brighter: let's not then fear leſt our Faith when 'tis ſaid open appeer filthy; but let falſ fucacious Religions be afraid of this. The Jew is loth to argu his Law with Chriſtians; and Mahometans are forbid to diſput the Alcoran; becauſ their Doctrins are brittle as glaſſ, broken with every touch: But a Chriſtian fears no examination, nay provokes his Adverſary to combat: thus he.

The Jews al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deteſt it, that God of his pure pleaſure ſhould affect the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem miſery of his chief Creatures, to ſhew the ſeverity of his Juſtice in tormenting them: or that the calamity and caſting away of moſt part, ſhould redound more to his glory, then the felicity of them al by his Mercy: thus he.

               <p>4. It hath affinity with the exploded error of Stoics and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, <note place="margin">4 Reaſon.</note> though differing from both: For Stoics held al actions and events fatal, either by the Heavenly Bodies impoſitions, or diſpoſitions of Natural cauſes; that one thing muſt neceſſarily folow another and be as they are, though God would hav ſom things otherwiſe. The Manichees maintain al Mens actions to be determined, the Good by a good God, who created al things Good; and the Evil by an Evil, who is Author of al evil. Now the Aſſerters of abſolut Decree defend, either that al acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (Natural, Moral, Good, Evil) and al events are ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; or elſ that al Mens ends are unalterable by any power in their Wils: which in effect is the ſame. For in vain is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in actions and means, if the end be decreed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſith al actions are for the ends ſake, to attain it by them, and involv the means which forego that end: as if a Man be predecreed to damnation; he muſt needs ſin, elſ he cannot be damned. In theſ three Opinions two things may be noted. 1. The ſubſtance or formality, which is an indeclinablenes of Mens actions and ends, wherin al conſort, that inſuperable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity predominats. Hence <hi>Melancthon</hi> charged the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> with Stoical error, caling abſolut Decree the Tables of Deſtiny. 2. The circumſtance or ground, wherin they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: For Stoics draw this neceſſity from the Stars or firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168435:77"/> Manichees from two firſt Principles eternal and coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: but Calviniſts from Gods peremptory Decree. The two firſt in ſom reſpects hav the better of this laſt: for 'tis ſafer to deriv neceſſity of evil from an evil God or Natures courſ, then from a good Gods decree. The firſt was condemned by the beſt Philoſophers, the next by al the Fathers: ſpecialy for the main matter, becauſ it made al things and events neceſſary, plucking up the roots of virtu, planting vice and leaving no place for reward or puniſhment: What then ſhal be ſaid of the laſt, who realy maintain the ſame?</p>

'Tis adverſ to ſound reaſon, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but impeach ſuch a Decree of extrem cruelty, far from the Father of mercy. For what natural Parent can reſolv to beget Children, and after birth living a while with him to hang up by the toung, tear off their fleſh with ſcourges, pul it from the bones with burning pinſers, or put them to other hideous tortures; only to ſhew his power and authority over them?

The defenders diſclaim this Tenet in direct terms, being ſo harſh to Chriſtian ears; but deliver it in truth by neceſſary conſequence. For they avouch the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation to be abſolut and inevitable; nor can Reprobats be ſaved, tho they doo al the works of Saints, ſith God created them to this very purpoſ, that they ſhould ſin, els he could not attain his principal ends, to manifeſt his mercy in ſaving the elect, and execut his juſtice in damning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats; who are eternaly decreed to ſin even to death. Thus ſay <hi>Piſcator, Marlorat, Zanchy,</hi> and many mo. This is by cleer conſequents to make God the Author of ſin: which is ordinarily imputed to thoſ who hav not ſuch intereſt or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in production of it, as this aſſertion aſcribes to God.

Yet the Devil only egs or excites Men by outward ſuggeſtions and inward tentations to ſin, which is al he can doo: but if God neceſſitats by his abſolut Decree, and after determinats by his powerful ſecret working in Mens Souls, and diſpoſing or overruling their Wils, that they cannot but ſin and periſh; he doth infinitly more, then barely ſuggeſt, intice, or perſwade; which is horrid to imagin.

So ſaith <hi>Moulin,</hi> who wil not abhor a King that to hang a man by Law, plots to make him a Thief or Murderer, that he may ſeem to doo it juſtly? For he ſhal not only make an innocent wretched, but wicked too, and deſtroy him for that offenſ wherof he is Author.

When two Cauſes concur to produce an Effect, one principal overruling, the other inſtrumental at the principals devotion: the Effect is aſcribed to the influx or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the former, and not to the later, which is only a ſubſervient Servant.

               <p>Another ſhift is ſuggeſted, that ſin is conſidered as ſin, and <note place="margin">4 Deviſe.</note> ſo God doth not deſtinat Men to it: Or as a means to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his Juſtice, and ſo he doth decree to puniſh it; yet is not the Author of ſin.</p>

               <p>This Poſition loads him with three indignities. 1. Want of Wiſdom, which muſt needs be weak if he can find no way to glorify his Juſtice but by bringing in ſin, which his Soul hates; that he may manifeſt it in puniſhing 2. Want of ſincerity or plain dealing: as <hi>Tiberius,</hi> purpoſing to deſtroy <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> (ſons to <hi>Germanicus</hi>) provoked them to revile him, that ſo he might juſtly put them to death. So if God, appointing Men to eternal perdition, decrees they ſhal ſin, that ſo they may be damned; he diſſembles like that Tyran, and deſtrois them under colour of Juſtice, for ſuch ſins as he draws them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, appointing it as a means of their ruin. 3.

The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, Neceſſity hath no Law, and Creatures or actions ſwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, are free from Laws. Lions are not forbid to prey, Birds to fly, or Fiſhes to ſwim, nor any thing to doo its kind ſith 'tis Natural or Neceſſary, they can doo no otherwiſe: But Laws are given to Rational Animals which hav liberty of Wil; yet not to ſuch as hav no uſe of Reaſon; nor to Men that can uſe it, ſav in thoſ actions that are voluntary: For none is forbid to hunger, thirſt, ſleep, weep, laugh, &amp;c. becauſ thoſ actions and affections are neceſſary, being trangreſſions of no Law, and <note place="margin">1 John 3. 4.</note> conſequently no ſins; as S. <hi>John</hi> concluds. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith, if it be deſtiny (as the Fathers cal abſolut Neceſſity) that Men are good or bad, they be neither good nor bad: So Virtu and Vice wil ſeem nothing but in opinion only, which is great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Impiety: For to what purpoſ was the Son of God made Man and a Sacrifice for ſin? Why was Miniſtry ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Heaven and Hel appointed? Faith, the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and al Religious Rites are meer Fables, if ſin be nothing. 2. Becauſ it bereavs al conſcience of ſin: for if it pleaſ or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Men, why ſhal they fear the perpetration which they cannot ſhun? or why weep and mourn, having ſinned, if they be neceſſitated? ſith ſin is an effect of that irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decree or nothing, tears may be ſo wel ſpared as ſpent. 3. Becauſ it cancels the guilt of ſin, ſith no fatal offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can juſtly be puniſhed either temporaly or eternaly; but <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 25, 26.</note> Neceſſity muſt bear the blame. God gav a Law, <hi>If a Maid be forced to incontinence, ſhe ſhal not dy,</hi> being rather a ſufferer then ſinner. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, The reward of good or evil cannot juſtly be given to ſuch as are ſo by neceſſity, and not freely.

So <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> If Stars impoſe a neceſſity of ſinning, they may with more Juſtice be puniſhed then Men: ſhal it then be ſaid that Gods Decree doth the ſame? <hi>Proſper</hi> ſaith, Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be juſt, if Men ſin by his Wil or determination. So <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> 'Tis great Injuſtice if God puniſh one whom he doth not find, but makes an Offender. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> refuting the Pharees (who held the Souls immortality and reſurrection of the Body, together with fatal neceſſity) ſaith 'tis meer madnes to grant a Ruſurrection and day of Gods righteous Judgment; yet to ſay ther is any fatality or neceſſity in Mens actions: for how can they cohere? which implies, that God neceſſitats none to ſin or damnation. Nor can his Judgments be juſt, if Men be held by the Adamantin chains of neceſſity under the power of ſinning; teach or preach in words what any can to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For by that poſition al our actions are Gods Ordinances, and imaginations branches of his eternal Decree: yea al events in Kingdoms and Stats neceſſary iſſues of divine Deſtiny: which wil makes al pillars of Piety and Principles of Policy totter or tumble to ground; the beſt Laws cannot reſtrain one ſin, the greateſt rewards promot one Virtu, the powerfulleſt Sermons convert one ſinner, the humbleſt devotions divert one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the ſtrongeſt endeavors effect any more then what wil be doon without them: Gods Decree doth al in al. <hi>Proſper</hi> ſaith, Whoever holds that Men are urged to ſin or damnation by Gods Predeſtination, as by inevitable neceſſity; he is no Catholic. Theſ Men preach clean contrary in ſhew, and dehort from ſin with terrible threats of vengeance: <hi>ſed eui bono,</hi> if Men by Decree be neceſſitated to doo it, and hav no poſſible power to decline it? <hi>Lazarus</hi> at Chriſts cal cam forth, but being bound could not walk, til he was looſed and let go. Nor can Men repent or com to Chriſt, ſo long as they ly faſtned with the fetters of neceſſity, under a fatal Decree, deprived from al power of Free-wil, til they ſhal be ſet at liberty by Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating Grace. The Arauſican Council ſaith, That any are predeſtinat to ſin by divine power; we not only not beleev, but with greateſt deteſtation denounce <hi>Anathema</hi> to ſuch (if any be) as will beleev ſo great an evil; which ſhal ſhut up this point.</p>

                  </label> for Gods Wil is no rule of juſtice to himſelf, as if things were juſt, becauſ he wils or works them; but his juſtice is rather a rule of his Wil and Works: who decrees and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts, becauſ they agree to that juſtice which dwels in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. So S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, God commands nothing ſav what is honeſt, but doth not make things honeſt which are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable: implying that he doth not wil a thing and ſo make it good; but willeth it becauſ 'tis antecedently good.

So Gods Wil is no rule of juſtice to himſelf, but to us; who muſt ſquare al our thoughts, words, and works by it as ſuprem rule of them. Nor are theſ abſolut decrees of ſalvation and damnation any parts of his reveled Wil in Scripture, which to aſſert is to beg the queſtion. This is al their ground to gain credit (as al ſects uſe to doo) but a falſ foundation, unles they may ſenſ it as they liſt. For abſolut Reprobation repugns right reaſon, and begets ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities which no Truths doth: ſith ſundry truths are reveled in holy Writ abov reaſon, but none contrary to it. Faith and Reaſon, Scripture and Nature are Gods excellent gifts, which never diametraly differ, tho ther is a diſproportion betwen them: if then abſolut Reprobation be unjuſt, it cannot be juſtified by Scripture. Therfore to ſay Gods Wil is the rule of Juſtice, and this a part of his reveled Wil (both which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are untru) is but a ſly evaſion and colorable colluſion.</p>

When God commanded his Creatures to increaſ and multiply, he gav them a generativ faculty: when Chriſt bad the lame Man riſe and walk, he added ability to his lims: ſo when the ſuprem Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver impoſeth a Law, he givs the people power to keep it: elſ he becoms a hard Maſter (as the evil Servant ſtiled his) reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wher he ſowed not, being the tru proper cauſ of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it.

               <p>4. It oppugns Gods truth and ſincerity, who is a God of truth without any fraud or falſhood. See <hi>Deut. 32. 4. 1 Sam. 15. 9. John 14. 6. Rom.</hi> 3. 4. God lovs thoſ that are tru of heart, and hates Hypocrits with his heart: but abſolut Reprobation makes him a Lier and Diſſembler; ſith he openly injoins ſuch to repent and beleev, whom he ſecretly intends ſhal not ſo doo. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one, and ye ſhal receiv the gift of the holy Ghoſt: for to you and</hi>

Every one (even Reprobats) is perſwaded he is under the gracious offer of eternal life, or elſ would not ſtrive ſo much to leav ſom boſom ſins, or doo hard duties: but by this Tenet moſt of thoſ to whom God offers Grace and Glory, ſhal attain neither, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> pronounceth. <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, Every one caled ought to think he is elected, elſ he accuſeth God of lying. So ſaith <hi>Bucer,</hi> A Man muſt beleev he is predeſtinat, or elſ makes God to mock when he caleth. Thus they ſeem ſollicitous that others ſhal not make God a mocker, yet they doo it moſt of al. For if a Creditor reſolvs to let his Debtor rot in priſon; yet ſhal profer, promiſſ, yea and ſwear to remit al the debt, upon certain conditions which he bars him to fulfil: would we not reput him a rank deluder or diſſembler? 'Tis eaſy to apply it. Al divine comminations are as Caveats to avoid the evil threatned: but if Mens perdition be peremptorily predecreed, it cannot poſſibly be prevented, which is plain deluſion: yea his paſſionat wiſhes that al wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be ſaved, are colorable colluſions: See <hi>Deut. 5. 29.

O that you had a Heart to fear me, and keep my Commandments that it might go wel with you for ever.</hi> Can God ſpeak thus (if he decrees they ſhal not beleev, or repent, or be ſaved) without deep diſſimulation?

Phiſitions miniſter medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins for the Patients good, which ſomtime by miſguidance turn to his hurt: ſo Gods bleſſings intended for Mens eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare, tend to their perdition by il imploying them. So the event doth not vary the intent, ſith no ſinful event is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly under Gods decree, but under his preſcience or permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at moſt.</p>
               <p>Now by this Tenet of abſolut Reprobation, al gifts both of Nature and Grace hav another end: for either God intends them not to ſuch (tho they enjoy them being mix'd with the elect, to whom only they are directed) or if he doth, 'tis only to puff them up abov the common rank of Men, to make their <note place="margin">L. 3. Inſt. c 24. §. 13.</note> ruin greater. So ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> God ſends his Word to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats that they may be made more deaf; ſets up a light to make them blinder, and affords a remedy, that they may not be healed. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, Let it not ſeem abſurd, that God offers Grace to ſom Reprobats, not to this end that they ſhould be ſaved; but that they may be leſſ excuſable and more puniſhable. <hi>Maccovius</hi> ſaith, God knocks at Reprobats hearts, who neither can nor wil open: not that he may enter, but partly to upbraid their impotence, and partly to increaſ their damnation, nor can any other concluſion riſe or reſult from this doctrin: for how can God intend the gifts of Grace for their ſalvation, whom he hath irrevocably decreed to damnation. Hence it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that God meerly deludes miſerable Men, whom he cals to ſalvation in his Sons name by preaching the Word; yet intends their perdition: and that Miniſters are falſ Witneſſes, who preach ſalvation to many conditionaly, whoſ damnation is decreed abſolutly. If a ſtate cloſly contriv, that no Dutch ſhal be Deniſens, yet publicly proclaim, to giv them high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges on condition to becom free; doo they not conterfet or coſen the poor people to make them ſu or ſeek in vain?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168435:88"/> Semblably, may not Reprobats rightly plead? Lord, wilt thou puniſh us for not beleeving in thy Son, being caled by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to beleev; when thou haſt decreed to leav us in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin without al power to beleev? How canſt thou juſtly charge us with ſin or increaſ our torment for not beleeving in him, whom thou reſolved ſt from eternity we ſhould never beleev in? Certes that Miniſtry givs Men a fair excuſe, which is given only to leav them without excuſe, as the Patrons of abſolut Decree proclaim. For the Sacraments ſignify nothing, ſeal up nothing, and confer nothing to ſuch as are not ſaved; but are meer blanks or empty Ordinances: yet not by their fault, but by Gods irreſiſtible Wil: nor are al other gifts tho never ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of any avail to promot their ſalvation in Gods abſolut intention; nor given out of lov but meer hatred, that they may uſe them il and prepare to themſelfs a greater damnation. For he that receivs moſt, of him ſhal moſt be required: ſo they be but as ſnares to intrap Mens Souls, like baits on barbed hooks to beguil Fiſhes: ſith they are lifted up therby, that with the load of their goodly indowments they may ſink the deeper into Hel. So they hav no cauſ to lov the Doner, but hate him rather; ſith ſuch favors are like a griping Uſurers bounty, or <hi>Jaels</hi> courteſy to <hi>Siſera.</hi>

'Tis prejudicial to Piety and Promoter of prophanes, <note place="margin">4 Reaſon.</note> cutting off the very ſinews of Religion: for it takes away al hope to attain happines by godlines, and fear to ſuſtain any hurt by wickednes; ſith al is ordered by abſolut Decree.

                  <hi>the joy ſet before him endured al ſhame of the Croſſ: who by it hardned his Diſciples to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> By this the godly in al ages hav bin excited to wel dooing. See <hi>Acts 24 15. Phil. 3. 26 Coloſ. 1 9 Titus 2. 12, 13. Heb. 11. per totum.</hi> Al noble Heroic acts hav ſprung from the hope of eternal glory. <hi>He that eareth and threſheth, muſt doo it in hope</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 10.</note> For hope (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) conduceth to action, as appeers in Souldiers, Mariners, and al Profeſſions. The hope of Heaven then is chief incentiv to piety, and fear of Hel a main bar to impiety: yea fear promots a good action accidentaly; becauſ
<pb facs="tcp:168435:89"/> Men fearing the evil of miſchief or miſery annexed to the evil of ſin think they are never ſafe, til they attain a contrary ſtate by doing wel. Now by an abſolut Decree, Hope and Fear are berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for hope is properly verſed about ſome good to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by induſtry, not which muſt be of neceſſity; and the object of fear is an evil that may be avoided: but by this Decree Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hel are no poſſible objects, but neceſſary: for the elect ſhal infallibly enjoy the one, and Reprobats impoſſibly eſcape the other: ſith Men hav no power to alter their eternal ſtate being prefined by eternal Decree. Al Gods decrees are immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, irreverſible, and irreſiſtible: ſo that al Mens indevors are in vain to alter or avoid them. See <hi>Iſai 46. 11. Pſ. 115. 3. Rom.</hi> 9. 19. 'Tis abſolutly decreed the Devils ſhal be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo it were folly in them by praier or tears to alter it: Mans Soul is ſimply decreed to be immortal, and 'tis vain for any to attemp the abolition. 'Tis ordained, that <hi>The Sun ſhal rule the day and Moon the night:</hi> what power then can divert their courſ? ſo if no power be left in Man to attain eternal life or avoid death; but he muſt needs take what is deſtined or deſigned; he ſtrivs in vain either way. For if the Decree be abſolut, the Miniſter preacheth and People hear in vain. Not one Soul can be ſaved by either of their means which is decreed to Hel; nor one damned deſigned to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 'Tis frivolous and fruitleſſ folly to be ſtudious or ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous in what cannot be altered, amended, or avoided: as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, why take ye thought about ſuch <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 25, 26.</note> things? 'Tis a miſery to toil about impoſſibles, as <hi>Siſyphus</hi> is ſaid to rol up a ſtone to the top of an high hil in Hel, which inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fals down again. If this perſwation be rooted or rivited, that both ſalvation and damnation depends on abſolut Decree; Miniſters may be fit inſtruments for Politic States to deter Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from enormous Offenſes: but can do no ſpiritual good, nor draw one Soul to God. 'Tis ſaid the Defenders of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin are pure pious Men, which open no gap to looſ life; but others pervert the truth to their own damnation. So the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures in defenſ of their dogmat (that the cheif Good conſiſted in carnal pleaſure) ſaid moſt of their Sects were honeſt Men: but <hi>Tully</hi> tels them, that this proceds rather from their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168435:89"/> diſpoſition, then curioſity of Opinion: therfore the force of honeſty prevailed more with them then the folly of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which they pleaded for. Another Apology is made, That though they teach abſolut Election and Reprobation; yet deſign not who is elected or rejected; but exhort Men to work out their ſalvation, and get aſſurance of it by good works; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they excite or encourage, not ſtifle or curb holy honeſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Indeed they doo ſo: But the ignorance of a Mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate alters not the caſe; for if I know the Decree is abſolut both wais, why ſhould I be ſollicitous of either; ſith it can doo no good nor hurt? nor can this knowledg at beſt be infallible in this vally of frailty, but is obſcured with many clouds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certity, in the point of undoubted perſeverance.</p>

                  <hi>are writ that by patience and comfort of the Scriptures we might hav hope.</hi> Now abſolut Reprobation procures tentation: for ſith ther be many mo Reprobats then Elect, the Devil can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwade one he is one of the moſt rather then feweſt; or at leaſt that al his labor is loſt, ſith the Decree is irrefragable and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable. <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaith, To doubt whether we be predeſtinat or no, is the head of every tentation: for he that doubts cannot confide he is caled or juſtified: So every Man muſt preſume he is elected. To what end then is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling?</hi> 'tis a <hi>Gorgons</hi> head to affright or amaze the Tempteds fancy, that the ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of conſolation applied with the beſt art, cannot avail. Gods lov to Mankind, Chriſts death for al, the caling of ſinners without exception of perſons, and al other motivs are eaſily eluded by this Opinion.

               <p>This is the pure Nepenthe of a ſick ſorowful Soul, and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> ſword to diſſolv the Gordian knot. Now the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of abſolut Reprobation, cannot uſe it againſt the Replies of the tempted, becauſ ther is a plain contradiction betwixt them. For if a Miniſter com to comfort one that thinks himſelf a direct Reprobat, how can he uſurp the univerſal promiſes (that God wil hav al to be ſaved, that Chriſt died for al) ſith he holds the contrary concluſion, that God wil hav moſt part to be damned, and hav no part in Chriſt? for the Tempted wil reply, That God would hav al to be ſaved by his reveled Wil not by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: and Chriſt died for al ſufficiently, not intentionaly: or if he intends it, 'tis with a condition, which he purpoſed moſt Men ſhould not perform: what then am I the neer, if I be none of thoſe to whom 'tis intended? Al that the Miniſter can reply
<pb facs="tcp:168435:91"/> is, Be comforted, you are a Beleever and ſorrowful ſinner; therfore no Reprobat. But al this the Tempted wil deny: how can he then convince him to be a Beleever or truly penitent? But the univerſal Promiſes wil perſwade Men to Repent and Beleev. <hi>Piſcator</hi> confeſſeth, That no ſure comfort can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into the Souls of afflicted Reprobats; but the Elect in this caſe may be comforted: yet muſt it be with the ſenſ of ſin, and deſire to be freed of it by Chriſt: which proofs are only probable at beſt, and to Men in tentation no comfort at al; ſith al depends on a bare peradventure, that the tempted is one of the Elect, which none knows but God. For Hypocrits make ſo fair ſhew of ſanctity, faith, and repentance as the beſt Zelots: yea ſuch as be ſincere may fal through frailty; and who can be aſſured he ſhal finaly perſever? So thoſ of this judgment are miſerable comforters or unwelcom Phiſitions to Men in ſuch heavy afflictions.</p>
               <p>If Men cenſure according to their fancies or Factions, they are Partialiſts, eſteeming al the Geeſ of their litle Flocks to be Swans, and abjure, abandon, or anathematize al others as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats. Ther be hundreds of Sects among Chriſtians, which chalenge to be Gods Choſen, renouncing al the reſt; yet haply al in error one way or other: how then can they judg aright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſearchers of the heart? yea ther be too many Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks and Ambodexters in every Sept, which ſhift ſtations with every wind, and turn with the tide: how then can any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Elect from Reprobats? But ſurely he that repents and beleevs (perſevering to the end) ſhal be ſaved, and impenitents damned.

But ungodly livers, ſenſible of Hel, tremble at the thought of it, as the moſt terrible of al terrors; and ſomtime refrain from their darling ſins, which fear of being annihilated could never doo. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaking of one who ſo feared death, as he deſired to <note place="margin">L. 17.

So certes they muſt be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and cenſured ſenſleſſ ſtocks or ſtones, who think a torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being in Hel, a leſſer or lighter evil then no being at al. Sir <hi>Fr.

Som evils and pains haply being but ſmal or ſhort, are leſſ then annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and one had better bear them then loſe his being; becauſ he may afterward attain ſo many deſirable things, as wil more then countervail his ſufferings: but if his torments be many and matchleſſ (yea endleſſ too) that he cannot joy in the good which remains, leaving no more but a poor comfortleſſ entity; it were ten thouſand times better for him to hav no being.

So to maintain with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lutherans, That God from foreknowledg of every Mans works, decreed to ſav ſom of free Mercy; and paſſ by the reſt to periſh in their ſins, is obnoxious to exceptions, becauſ it makes him an accepter of perſons.

            <pb facs="tcp:168435:98"/>
            <p>Laſtly, S. <hi>Marc</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egipt</hi>

It was long after yer <hi>Corinth</hi> had any, which cauſed ſuch Schiſms or ſtrifes among the Elders: yet many Apoſtolic Men (<hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Cret, Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> at <hi>Rome, Denys</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi>) preſided in Neighbor Sees; who in time placed Biſhops at <hi>Corinth</hi> and other Cities: which is a pregnant pedigree of Epiſcopal Hiſtory for the firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of Chriſt. Afterward when queſtion aroſ, which Churches ſhould hav Biſhops, which not? It was regulated by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Cities, or multitud of Presbyters requiſit to ſuch charges; and by ſlow degrees ſetled through the world. Hence <hi>Sardinia</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Can 6.</note> Synod ordered, That no ſmal Towns ſhal hav Biſhops wher a few Prieſts may ſerv; but only Populous places that deſerv one, or antiently had one.

Now as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters aſſiſted the Apoſtles, who caled them felow-Elders, though not equals: So they aſſiſted Biſhops in ſacred matters; ſpecialy of Ordination, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> informs. So ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> He did nothing of himſelf without Counſil of his Clergy, and conſent of the People. And S. <hi>Ambroſ,</hi> That nothing was doon in the Church without the Elders adviſe. Hence Biſhops and Elders are oft caled by the ſame names, yet of diſtinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; becauſ both concurred in functions; being ſtiled Prieſts <note place="margin">Sacerdotes.</note> in reſpect of divine ſervice; Elders in regard of age or gravity; and Preſidents or Prelats in relation to their rule. Thus their <note place="margin">Phaesbytert. Antiſtices.</note> titles were oft confounded, but Orders and Offices ſtil diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; which no braſſ-brow can gainſay. S. <hi>Ambroſ</hi> renders a reaſon, why S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructing <hi>Timothy,</hi> paſſeth from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to Deacons; becauſ every Biſhop is a Presbiter and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, not convertibly; but he chief over both.</p>
            <p>Many maintain, That Presbyteries primarily conſiſted part of Clerics, part of Laics; as the Jews Sanedrim had ſom Prieſts and Levits, ſom Elders of the People: but 'tis falſ; for

That Elders and Elderſhips in Scripture were ſacred Officers repreſenting the Church. 2. That Chriſt hath a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom, wherof ſecular Magiſtrats are Vicegerents; and a ſpiritual committed to Church Officers: as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and his Sons ſhal wait on the Prieſts Office:</hi> and a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That no Independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Elderſhips are <hi>Jure divino.</hi> 4. That Chriſt gav the Keis to his Apoſtles and their ſpiritual ſucceſſors; but not to <note place="margin">Mat. 16 19. Mat. 18 18. John 20, 23.</note> al Members of the Church. Al which are tru Poſitions, if the head Rulers be included; elſ 'tis no Church Government of divine Inſtitution. For no Societies, Companies, Colleges or Corporations can be complet without their ſeveral Heads, as right Epiſcopacy is a regulated Presbytery, but ſingle Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery without a Biſhop (who may not be ſecluded or ſeparated) Epiſcopat beheaded. 'Tis ſaid, That in the black Moneth a headleſſ Horſ wanders the ſtreets with a chain about his neck; which haply now is fulfilled, if the Church becom an Anarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acephalon, and the World an Antipodical Anarchy. That anſwer hath two main defects: 1. In not declaring the whol truth, that the Apoſtles were Heads or Preſidents over al Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and before their deaths deputed Biſhops to be ordinary Rulers (themſelfs being extraordinary) in their ſteads. 2. In not explaining, whether Lay-Elders may be admitted among Church-Officers, which ſeems to bee a mungrel mixture? But al Sects learn that craft of Satan, to concele what makes moſt againſt them. Certes Epiſcopat and Elderſhips are Correlats;
<pb facs="tcp:168435:101"/> nor can ther be a tru Presbytery without a Prelat. Whence Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> when they reformed Religion, and had expelled their Popiſh Prelat Soveraign of the State, offered to readmit him, if he would renounce the Papacy: but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, erected this new form of Miniſters and Laics to draw in joint yoke together, to pleaſ his Popular Patrons. He wiſhed (as his felows did) to hav Proteſtant Prelats as in <hi>England;</hi> or Superintendents (which are analogical Biſhops) as elſwher; for they are truly Chriſtian, yea of Apoſtolic Inſtitution; not Anti-Chriſtian, unles Antichriſt be the head; and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds ſuffred Martyry under Pagan tyranny, beſide ſom here in the Marian perſecution: therfore ſuch aſperſions ſavour more of ignorant malice then tru charity: for it may ſincerly be ſaid ſans ſcandal, that Epiſcopacy ſtood eſtabliſhed in this land ever ſince the dawn of Chriſtianity under <hi>Lucius</hi> a Brytiſh King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <note place="margin">An C. 180.</note> 1500 yeers, both by antient and later Laws from age to age. So that if the primitiv form of Church government be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it cannot be exiled: for if <hi>Titus, Timothy,</hi> and the reſt were ruling Elders over Presbyters, it ſhould be ſo ſtil; yet 'tis not ſimply unalterable, if weighty cauſes require an abolition. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> rightly reputed <hi>Aerius</hi> an Heretic (though it be no point of Faith but Faction, and ſuch ſince ſtiled Schiſmatics) for oppoſing Epiſcopacy: ſith if it ſhould be granted (which can never be proved) that 'tis a meer Human Ordinance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic Men: yet poſſeſſion and preſcription of 1500 yeers ſans violence or uſurpation, is enough to inſtal it in a firm right free from extirpation, if their be any ſure ſetled ſtate on Earth. For St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> no friend to that Order for his teen againſt <hi>John</hi> the proud Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (under whoſ Juriſdiction he lived long at <hi>Bethleem Juda</hi>) freely agniſeth; that the peace of particular Churches cannot be conſerved without it, being the beſt means to ſuppreſſ Schiſms, Sects, and Hereſies, which ſwarm like Locuſts in the open Sun. Many abuſes are crept up, ſpecialy in committing too much power to Lay. Chancelors; and detracting diverſ priviledges from Presbyters; beſide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiv avarice of ſom Biſhops which reigns in ſcarlet Robes ſo il as in lawn ſleevs; al which may be reformed, and priſtin procedings reſtored, without weeding out pure Wheat
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168435:101"/> with Tares, Cockles and Darnel; which wiſe Husbandmen wil not doo: but what diſorders may grow upon its utter era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication (as al alterations are perilous) none but Gods alſeing Ey can foreſee.</p>
            <p>To ſum up al, theſ are Oraculous verities: 1. That Chriſt <note place="margin">Summary.</note> during life kept al rule in his ſole power, but after Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection commended it to his Apoſtles by a Triple charge to <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep.</hi> 2. That when Beleevers increaſed, they erected Elders every wher to officiat under them. 3. That before their deaths they ordeined ſom Diſciples as Superiors over ſeveral Churches and Presbyteries. 4. That ſuch were ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prelats (ſet over) and Biſhops or Overſeers. 5. That <hi>Peter and James</hi> Apoſtles; <hi>Marc</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> Evangeliſts; <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Lynus</hi> two of the ſeventy Diſciples; <hi>Titus, One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, Evodius, Clemens, Lucius, Apelles, Denys Areopagit, Polycarp, Ignatius, Anacletus</hi> (Apoſtolic Men) were actual Biſhops in ſeveral Sees, as <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Irenaeus</hi> truſty Truſtees avow. 6. That in after ages Biſhops were choſen by Presbyteries, not occaſionaly like Preſidents or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators in Councils; nor annualy as Maiors of Cities; but perpetualy for life, like Maſters of Colleges to govern their Dioceſes. 7. That ſuch continued in al chriſtian Churches by the titles of Biſhops or Prelats, til <hi>Luther</hi> ſtiled them Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents. 8. That after-Records or Catalogs of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal continued ſucceſſions, are extant every wher beyond cavil or contradiction. 9. That al Elders or Presbyters (with Deacons, Evangeliſts, &amp;c.) were Clergy Men by impoſition of hands, til <hi>Calvin</hi> occaſionaly admitted Laics Joint Rulers in ſhew with Clerics: which form hath ſince crept into a few Churches, as novities ſtil find vulgar intertainment like new Brooms. 10. That ther is no ſemblable color for conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet Lay-Elders to meddle in Church matters; nor ever were any ſuch except Church-Wardens to keep the common Stock, Goods, and Utenſils ſafe.

Theſ were attended with infallible Signs and Wonders, while he taught the Myſteries of his Kingdom, and inſtituted holy Rites to diſtinguiſh his Church from the World, by thoſ Seals and Pledges of his lov, in dying for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168435:102"/> the Faithful, when he ſhed both Blood and Water on the Croſſ. Which having perſonaly accompiiſhed as to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorius part of his Miniſtry, he being no more to converſ in a viſible Human preſence on Earth, did after his Reſurrection commit the Keis of his Kingdom to the twelv Apoſtles afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen, as Stewards or Miniſters of his Houſhold, inſtructing them on what fundation of Faith to build his Church, and by what Sacramental Signs to confirm Beleevers; bidding them to Teach and Baptiſe al Nations, to ordein Diſciples that ſhould ſucced, and ſo breathed on them: promiſing to ſend his Spirit (as he did after his Aſcention) and to be with them til the Worlds end. This cannot be meant of their Perſons who ſhortly died, but of their Survivers or Succeſſors in the Miniſtry to whom the ſame Authority and aſſiſtance belongs by divine durable Charter or Commiſſion: for publication and confirmation wherof the Holy Ghoſt cam on them in ſhape of firy Cloven Toungs, filling them with miraculous gifts fit for the firſt planting of the Church and al Miniſterial power derivable to others, for propagation and perpetuity therof. Which whol fram or Fabric was the proper effect of his Prophetic Wiſdom for inſtructing his Church; an Act of his Kingly power in governing it, and the fruit of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care for a right Liturgy, or Officiating to be ſtil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by an holy Succeſſion of Evangelical Miniſters in his Name; to Teach, Guid and Govern it in al holy Duties. He made Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers for the work of Miniſtry, and edyfying of his body: who had diverſ gifts, as be ſeveral parts in our body; ſo that al are not Prophets or Paſtors which are Beleevers or Members, as every bodyly part is not an Ey, tho it partakes the ſame Soul, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers doo the ſame Spirit in differing miniſtrations: of which Gifts thoſ only are to Judg, whom the Spirit ſets Succeſſivly in the Church with power to ordein others: without which divinely conſtituted Order began by Chriſt, derived to the Apoſtles, and delegated to their Succeſſors; the Church long ago had bin a Monſter made up of confuſed excreſcences or heaps of Hereſies, Sects, Schiſms, and blind Baiards, as ſuch miſhapen prodigies ſtart up daily: who having caſt off Sacred
<pb facs="tcp:168435:103"/> Order, doo in their varieties exced the promiſcuous produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions even of <hi>Afric.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles accordingly firſt filled up <hi>Judas</hi> place by Lot out of the ſeventy Diſciples; and took care to ordain others which ſhould ſo doo after them; diſtributing their own labors into ſeveral Churches; ſom of Circumciſed Jews, others of Gentils, among whom they exerciſed Divine power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with al fidelity, as Chriſts Ambaſſadors, Heralds, and Laborers in his Husbandry, or Eſpouſers to make a Mariage betwen Chriſt and the Church: which office none without do delegation might preſum to perform. During which primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv purity, they ordeined Elders in every City and Country, charging them to fulfil the Miniſtrey and feed their Flocks (both in tru Doctrin and good Diciplin) over whom the Lord had made them Overſeers by the Apoſtles aſſignation. Som of which had charge to ſettle a Succeſſion of ſuch as ſhould be apt and able to teach the Word of Life, that Chriſts Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution might be kept unblamable, til his ſecund coming, by an holy Order or Office of Miniſters duly made by ſolen impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſacred hands, as a viſible token of their peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to this function. Thus beyond al doubt or diſput (which none but Atheiſts or Infidels wil deny) Chriſts holy Ordinance was carried on ſucceſſivly for three genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 1. In the Apoſtles: 2. From them to Elders and Rulers: 3. From them to others which were ordeined Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, as is evident in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next ſucceſſion is cleer by teſtimony of <hi>Clement</hi> and other Apoſtilic Men beyond exception or evaſion: al which entring by the Dore, are as tru Shepherds, Stewards, Fathers, Rulers and Watchmen over the Flock: being caled the Light of the World, Salt of the Earth, Fiſhers of Men, Stars in his right hand, Angels of the Churches, &amp;c. who are charged to Preach the Word in ſeaſon and out; to feed Lambs, to care for the Flock, to fulfil their Miniſtry, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, command, and Rebuk with al Authority; to whom Chriſt gav many peculiar privileges and promiſes of ſpecial aſſiſtance. Hence 'tis cleer as the Noonday, that ſom (not al) and thoſ ordeined (not voluntiers) are ſent ſucceſſivly by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:168435:103"/> Chriſts authority, to doo the work of the Miniſtry: which dreadful imploiment injoined, with a bitter Wo if neglected, the very Angels wil not undergo unles ſent, nor then without horror: much leſſ ſhould ſinful Men (to whom a duple Wo is du) deſperatly dare to intrud being unſent, uncaled, unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, and unfurniſhed; which is proud preſumption. As then ſom are duly inveſted with Miniſterial power, and ſtrictly injoined to uſe it for the Churches good: ſo al others not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered (tho never ſo wel gifted) are flatly forbid to uſurp that ſacred Office, or confer what they never received on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: which neither <hi>Melchiſedec, Moſes, Aaron, Samuel,</hi> nor any of the Prophets; no nor Chriſt, John Baptiſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Evangeliſts, or any tru Biſhops and Presbyters ever durſt to arrogat, without divine miſſion or commiſſion me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly or immediatly derived from Chriſt.

Surely al divine Miniſtrations of Preaching, Celebrating the Sacraments, and other Ordinances neceſſary to the being (ſo wel as wel being) of a Church, had ceaſed long ſince, if God had aſſigned no peculiar Men to hold forth the great Salvation, which leavs Men excuſeleſſ: ſith they are taught by ſuch as hav ſpecial Characters or Letters of Credence from Chriſt: if they wil not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, or Men ſent by him; whom wil they beleev? Ther be four ſorts of Laborers in Gods har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: ſom ſent by him ſoly, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> moſt Prophets, the twelv Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul:</hi> ſom by Gods aſſignation, but Mans Ordination; as <hi>Aaron, Joſua, Eliſha, Timothy:</hi> ſom by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the Church, yet of Chriſts inſtitution; as al Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

For no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever though indued with great Gifts and Graces (as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ</hi> had before he becam Biſhop) ought to aſſum Miniſterial power: for then every Chriſtian of both Sexes (as ther be ſundry She-Preachers, which pretend to the Spirit in theſ licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious times) may claim the Keis to themſelfs, and diſpenſ Holy things to others, or rule Chriſts Houſhold in his ſtead; which repugns common Reaſon; as if every domeſtic Servant or Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſhould chalenge the Stewards place, or every Member arrogat the office of Eys, Toung, or Hands; becauſ they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſame Soul, Body, and Head. Sith then no Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moral, or Religious gifts or abilities can inſtate any to be a Magiſtrat, Judg, Ambaſſador, or public Officer; unles he be inveſted by the Fountain of Civil power. So ther ſhould be a right derivation of Spiritual Power from Chriſt Jeſus as Head; either immediatly as the Apoſtles had, or mediatly as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters ſince; who without fraud, force, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Uſurpation received it from the Apoſtles by Praier, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and impoſition of Hands in Chriſts name. Which pregnant truth moroſely to deny, is as if an Hog ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer al Arguments with grunting. Yea to act againſt ſo ſtrong a ſtream of authority; befits only Ranters, Seekers, Shakers, and Enthuſiaſts; or Jews, Turcs, and Infidels: but not ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or Members of the Church, which ever enjoyed a tru ſucceſſion of ordeined Miniſtry: wherby the Goſpels light is continued to this day amidſt al Pagan perſecutions, Hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal confuſions, and Schiſmatical Fractions bent to undermine it. Al Nations by Natures lore owned ſom Deity, and had peculiar Perſons to execut Religious Rites; nor did ever any ſober Men reject Gods ſervice for Miniſters faults, frailties, or infirmities. For a Divine muſt be diſtinguiſh'd from the Man, ſith Gods power works with human weaknes, nor need we be more nice or nauſeous. Laſtly ther is a neceſſity of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined Miniſtry, ſith none of free accord wil undergo ſo hard

               <p>Certes Church-reformation is to be carried with al accurat rigour in cleer points of ſaving Truths; but with much eandor, charity, and circumſpection toward Chriſtians in other things, wherin we differ or diſſent. 'Tis a laudable Schiſm to ſeparat gold from droſſ, not retaining both in confuſion, nor rejecting both in paſſion: wherby they ſhal not only reform abuſes, but invite Men to embrace or approv our wel tempered zele, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſee their own defects or deformity: For Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is beſt doon, not by cutting off Religions head; but by taking off the Viſors which hide its beauty; ſith Men wil beſt ſee their errors, not by tearing out their eyes, but by fairly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the films or beams of prejudice and pertinacy, which obvele or hinder their ſight. By this ſhield of moderat charity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving al things and holding what is good, we juſtly defend al Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches from the ſin and ſcandal of Schiſm; when we truly declare to ſeparat no farther from them, then we are perſwaded they hav ſwerved from Chriſt and the Catholic Church. We are bid to com out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but not to run out of our wits; to act as Gods People with meeknes and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168435:107"/> charity, not with firy fiercenes and cruelty, like ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> running from one Antichriſt to another: For Papiſts hav much of Antichriſt in ſom kinds, and ſo may many mo in others: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by innovations, confuſions, or chiefly uncharitablenes. For if nothing ſavours more of Chriſt then Charity; nothing hath leſſ of Chriſt then the contrary; which many Men miſtaking for zele nouriſh a Cockatrice for a Dov, and a Serpent for a Phaenix. This freeth us from the brand of Schiſmatics, ſuch as the Novatians and Donatiſts were (like our modern Sectiſts) who ſo claimed to be a tru Church, as to exclud al others from communion or accord. Som cry out upon Papiſts cruelty (which hath bin too barbarous) yet they uſe more both againſt them and their Brethren; longing for ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt as ſhal conſiſt in War, Blood, and Maſſacres againſt al except thoſ of their own ſide or Sect. We may not imput the errors or enormities of every Popiſh Doctor to al that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nor take them at the worſt; ſith ther is much difference betwen their public diſputs and privat practiſes; nor are their death-bed Tenets alwais conform to their Chairs or Pulpits: Yea many are much more modeſt and moderat then hertofore; wherin we ought to rejoice: But for the People moſt are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſ Diſputs, wherin to er wilfully is dangerous: which if they hold, being ſo taught, yet 'tis under perſwation or lov of Truth; retaining the foundation of Chriſt crucified, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſalvation by his ſole merits; of whom we ſhould judg cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, that God in Mercy accepting their lov to truth which they know, wil pardon particular errors, which they know not to be ſuch: judg as you wil be judged.

Our Antiminiſterial Antagoniſts hav leſſ color to argu it Antichriſtian from Papal uſurpation; then ther is Reaſon, Scripture, and Experience (beſide common conſent of al Reformed Churches) to prov it Authentic: For if envy, teen, and avarice did not blind their bloodſhot eys, they might cleerly ſee ſom mighty works wrought on Mens Souls by the Miniſtry: without which thoſ cavilling calumniators had not bin ſo much Chriſtian as they boaſt to be; nor ſo able to contend with ſpecious ſhews of Piety againſt the learned Miniſtry, with whoſ Heifers they plough, having nothing but what they received from them, and are moſt ingrat wretches to their priſtin Teachers.</p>
               <p>We know that many Churches beſide Reformed (Gallican, <note place="margin">Popes Primacy began A 604.</note> Venetian, Grecian, Ruſſian, Aſian, African) deny the Popes univerſal Primacy of power, being bought by proud <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. of proditorious <hi>Phocas</hi> the Parricid, abov 1000 yeers ago; who by Divine Right had no Juriſdiction farther then his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſ or Patriarchat, limited by general Councils: wher four other Patriarchs (of <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>) had equal authority aſſigned in their ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts or Provinces, as al know.

For the envious and ambitious zele of ſuch Antiprelatical Spirits aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtep up into their ſteads, hath produced ſad events, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168435:109"/> given their Enimies great advantage: ſo they hav work enough to keep the Lepry from their own Heads, which they told the People had ſo fouly infected Biſhops hands, as could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be clenſed unles cut off: but al mortals are apt to doo amiſſ, and 'tis never too lat to rectify miſcarriages. Moſt Men confes (nor can impudence gainſay it) that the Order or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is lawful, wherby al Chriſtian Churches were Governed: however ſom inconveiniences (yea miſchiefs too) ariſe from corruption of finful Men in al Profeſſions. Tho then Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copy hath bin much ſhaken or depreſſed by power, paſſion, or privat ends, to the impairing and indangering of the whol fabric or function: yet wiſe Men may after this thick duſt of diſput ſee, what is of God therin, and regulat it by paring off what is depraved or deformed, and reſtore it to primeval puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Tis now no need to fear or flatter Biſhops faces, whoſ glory is gon; but meer matter of Conſcience to teſtify truth: ſith thoſ of different judgments take freedom to beſpatter them ſo unjuſtly and unſavourly; as they hoped by their il breath to blaſt that venerable caling, and render it odious or execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to weak Chriſtians, which to wiſe Men was ever like <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Ointment poured out. Nor doth it loſe divine fragrance by the fracture of il times, which paſſionatly break the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſter boxes of civil protection, which preſerved it for many ages from vulgar inſolence and Schiſmatical violence. The like liberty is lawful to vindicat it by pregnant places of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precepts and precedents, ſecunded with Catholic cuſtom and practiſ of the Church, and confirmed by the Laws of this Land.</p>
               <p>To omit the main controverſy of its lawfulnes, and to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten two Wals with one Trowel; two points principaly ſhal be handled: 1. To remov a popular Odium or Plebeian paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and prejudication; taken up by weak (yet haply wel mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Chriſtians, againſt Biſhops Preſidential authority over Presbyters. 2. to juſtify the holy Miniſterial Ordination duly doon by their hands. One rub riſeth from their lat diſaſters, whom if Arguments and Words could not, yet Arms and Swords hav ſuppreſſed. For vulgar minds are apt to judg thoſ unjuſt that are unproſperous, and curſed who are puniſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:168435:110"/> as Turcs uſe to doom.

For ther were pious Prelats prepoſited abov Presbyters, before any Civil power protected them; and by Gods Grace may ſo continu, maugre al oppreſſion or perſecution. The things of Chriſt and tru Religion may not be received or refuſed, as Uſhered in or crowded out by Civil power: nor doth Chriſt ſteer his Ship by that compaſſ: ſith at the ſame rate of Worldly frowns, we ſhould hav no Scriptures, Sacraments, ſound Doctrins, or holy Ordinances; but al had bin turned into Heatheniſh bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, Hereticla errors, and Schiſmatical confuſions: if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God and Chriſt had not conſerved theſ ſacred things, by the pious patience of holy Biſhops and Miniſters, whom wicked Worldlings ever hated: ſeeking to deſtroy root and branch through the ſides of Epiſcopacy. Biſhops Government as referred to the chief office of Ordination, is no way Popiſh or Antichriſtian, as too many ignorantly or malitiouſly chatter: tho the pride, ambition, or avarice of ſome Prelats, might make them juſtly odious, becauſ contrary to Chriſts precept and patern: whoſ place Biſhops as cheif Paſtors or Parents among Presbyters, hav alwais ſince the Apoſtles eminently held in the extern polity or Regiment of the Church.

Certes, the learnedſt Presbyterians are beſt Friends, and blind Zelots bittreſt Foes to tru Epiſcopat: who want ſcience, prudence, humility and charity; which is the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of Chriſtianity. Orderly Presbytery which admits one to Preſide, is a leſſer Epiſcopy to overſee particular Flocks: yet not to expel or extirp Biſhops; nor is headleſſ or many head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbytery neceſſary by divine right: but primitiv Prelacy (which imports one grav worthy Perſon choſen by conſent, and aſſiſted by counſil of ſundry Presbyters to preſide over them) is to be preferred before al other forms for many weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inſuing.</p>

               <p>4. Tru Epiſcopat never had had a free, ful, or fair hearing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as ſo great a matter requires: nor was it ever convicted to repugn Scripture, as ſom ſhameleſly aſſert. For it neereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Gods protopatern ſetled among the Iſraelits: who had Heads of Elders like Biſhops with Prieſts and Levits as <note place="margin">Epiſt ad Evag.</note> Presbyters and Deacons according to S. <hi>Jeroms</hi> parallel.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their inſtitution much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Judaic cuſtoms: as to Baptiſe with Water, to uſe Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, to ſolemnize Weekly the Lords Day in the Sabbaths ſtead, to giv Paſtors and Teachers power of the Keis: nor is any expreſſ precept or evident precedent againſt Epiſcopat, either commanding parity, or forbidding <note place="margin">Luk 11. 25. 26.</note> orderly ſuperiority in Church or Commonweal, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inhibits his Apoſtles (who were coequal or coordinat) to exerciſe dominion like ſecular Princes: which is a Rule for al Churches not to uſe any preeminence by ambition, tyranny, violence, or uſurpation on the Bodies, Eſtats, Lifes, or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men in Worldlings way: yet ſuch courſes (beſide fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious emulations) are ſo incident to ſom inſolent Presbyters, as to the proudeſt Prelats. Our Saviours ſenſ is plain, that what ever parts, power, place, gifts, or Graces any Miniſter hath abov others; he ſhould uſe them with humility to Gods Glory and the Churches good: laying aſide the levan of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious oppreſſion: but the very Apoſtles (who had a priority of place with parity of power among themſelfs) exerciſed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of juriſdiction over al other Diſciples and Beleevers, who obeied them as Fathers, doing the like to Biſhops after them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> being to leav the World, left a patern of Church-Government (which was conſtantly purſued) in ordeining <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> Biſhops, giving them perſonal power to ordein, cenſure, rebuk, or ſilence al Elders and Deacons under their charge.

               <p>5. Common Reaſon requires a power and polity in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Church ſo wel as in Cities, Armies, or any Civil ſocieties. For the Lord of his Church hath not diveſted or denied it good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which may lawfully be uſed with Wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: nor may Miniſters which excel others in age, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and gubernativ gravity be barred to employ their Gifts in ſutable differences for the Churches behoof. Only Chriſt requires humility in priority (which many Prelats had, and mo Presbyters wanted) and ſervice in ſuperiority proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to their parts, which God givs not in vain. For ſom Miniſters are young, proud, prone to faction and paſſion, whoſ folly and fervor needs a bridle of Epiſcopal authority to curb them, beyond common contemptible parity.

But this Government of a Paternal preſident among Presbyters, hath far ſurer grounds from Scripture and Antiquity, then any newfangled form or faſhion; as having the preponderating privilege of uniform univerſal Polity practiſed by al Churches in pureſt times; wherto neither of thoſ can with any face pretend. 'Tis ſtrange how impudently many Men cite or rather rack ſom broken peeces of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian.

Whatever ſom Fathers are wreſted or wrenched to ſpeak for Miniſterial parity, or Popular independency; 'tis only to reprov ſom Prelats arrogance, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tyranny: who uſurped ſole power, neglecting Presbyters adviſe and aſſiſtance; or when ſom Eccleſiaſtic Officers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the People, whom primitivly both Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters duly regarded in al public concernments of the Church. It were needleſſ and endleſſ to excuſe their Perſonal errors or exorbitances, which are apt to attend al power among Men: yet no wiſe Man wil reckon them genuin effects of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb facs="tcp:168435:113"/> Order; ſith their Accuſers would be worſe if they had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel power: for ther is nothing uſeful or laudable in any other way, which is not incluſivly and eminently in that order: nor any error or enormity therin, which is not incident and impendent to Presbytery or any other Polity; though that perhaps purer in primitiv then later ages. So what Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 2. ſaid of Clerical Celibat (he ſaw ſom reaſon why marriage ſhould be prohibited to Prieſts; but much more why it ſhould be permitted) the ſame may be applyed to right conſtituted Epiſcopacy: nor can Presbytery or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſhew any ſuch tru title of divine right; which infolds al the good of both thoſ, and ſuperads unity of order beyond both for the common good. Som preſſ the National Covenant againſt it, as if that were a ſufficient battery beyond Scripture, Reaſon, Antiquity, Civil Law, and Catholic cuſtom; al which approv it: But ſom chief compoſers confeſſ, that their main ſcope or ſenſ was againſt Biſhops corrupt government and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, to reform what was decaied or depraved, and retain what was ſound or ſincere. However, ſith that Covenant is no divine infallible Oracle, but a civil Engin of ſinful paſſionat Men for ſelf ends (on whoſ heads the arrow fel, which they ſhot againſt others) al its words and intentions muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the rule of good conſcience, right reaſon, and holy writ: nor ſhould Antiquity and the Fathers ſtoop or ſubmit to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Noveliſts (many of whoſ acts are found faulty or factious:) Nor doth it make ought for headleſſ Presbytery or heady In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency; no nor againſt pure primeval Prelacy. For ſom ſtif ſticklers for Presbytery, ſeing the miſchiefs of late changes, confeſſ, they know nothing unlawful therin, but many godly Men held it inconvenient: ſo this long bloody debat reſults on the judgment of Prudence, not Conſcience; of Policy, not Piety. Yet to cloke their malice, they cunningly ſoddered Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Prelacy together, implying both to be inſeparable Birds of a Feather, then which nothing is more rediculous, falſ, and ſlanderous: For many good Biſhops at <hi>Jeruſalem, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, Alexandria</hi> preceded <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſundry afterward in other Provinces, equal to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not depending on him, as be diverſ at this day: Nor is the Pope Founder or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168435:113"/> of Epiſcopat, nor caled or counted Antichriſtian as Prelat or Patriarch of one Province; for then al Biſhops are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, and Chriſts whol Church for 1500 yeers Antichriſtian, which is barbarous to conceiv, and blaſphemous to conteſt. The Pope becam Antichriſt upon another ſcore, when <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> 3. with his ſucceſſors, uſurped the ſtile of univerſal Biſhop, or Gods Vicar General; which his penultimat prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor (<hi>Gregory</hi> 1.) foredoomed to be Antichriſts Forerunner.

I. I. I.) as every ey may ſee. Semblably that Covenant contains juſt 666 words, as he that tels them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly ſhal ſurely find; which may ſeem ominous in both. Moſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Boniface,</hi> were humble Men, and very many holy Martyrs; who abhorred the name of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop or Head of the Church as Antichriſtian: but thoſ ſince grew proud preſumptuous perſecutors, introducing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſuperſtitions, contrary to Chriſts Inſtitutions and Canons of the Catholic Church; for which abuſes our Church with others refuſed their communion.</p>

Yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns al Presbyters ordeined by them, ſith al derived from one original root (branch after branch) of pretended Papal Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Our Biſhops ordeining Miniſters in preſence of Presbyters, by their joint laying on of hands with faſting and prayer, did but their duty injoined by 1500 yeers preſcription, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Princes, Prelats, Peers, Presbyters, and People in Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo they cannot be puniſhed in that regard, nor charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a privat crime, which is doon in obedience to public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; much leſſ aboliſhed in that behalf, ſith they had our Churches warrant, and vote of al others which retain that order, beſide the good liking of thoſ that hav it not. Why then are
<pb facs="tcp:168435:114"/> Biſhops extruded? is not covetouſnes the root of al evil? But Presbyters, two or mo, hav no warrant to ordein or exerciſe any Juriſdiction without a Biſhop in chief; nor is a Biſhop forbid to ordein and rule aſſiſted by Presbyters: but ſimple Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery Acephalon Anarchy. Civil Magiſtrats may regulat the exerciſe, but cannot confer the Office of Biſhop or Presbyter, which flows from a ſpiritual Head Chriſt Jeſus: nor can Acts of Parlement with juſtice or honor diſmount the Canons of Oecumenic Councils, Catholic Cuſtoms, or Laws of the Church. If it be ſaid or ſuppoſed, that the lat Parlement only reſtored, and Presbyters reſumed their power of Ordination, which Biſhops unjuſtly uſurped; why did they never claim it here or elſwher for al paſt ages, til laſt factious tumultuous times? If they crav only a joint right with Biſhops, yet ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat; they may enjoy it ſtil, giving their Betters preeminence for orders ſake: but their fond ambition to ingroſſ al without and againſt them, hath loſt al power to both, and marred al by overweening.

Nor doo ſuch impotent impudent toungs tuned to vulgar ears againſt Epiſcopal caling becom Men which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to piety, learning, goodnes, gravity, charity, civility, or common chriſtianity. Biſhops perſonal faults can no more be excuſed then Presbyters or any others in the exerciſe of their Functions: But ſom malecontents, like water violently pent up by Fludgates, violently break forth, and bear away the whol ſluce of Government; which might be better managed or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by du bounds ſet to both.</p>
               <p>Ordinary Miniſters ſeem as younger Brothers (who lived handſomly or happily under their Fathers tuition) ſcattered or expoſed to al injuries and miſeries, that many as prodigal Sons, are fain to feed on the husks of popular favors; who may not repine at the meaſure offred by others, which they inſolently meted to their Fathers, <hi>Elies</hi> ſcandalous Sons annulled not their ſervice or ſacrifices, much leſſ the Prieſtly Office, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on the perſons adminiſtring, but Gods authority

So that the miſdemenors or miſcarriages of Biſhops and Miniſters, may blot or blemiſh the beauty; but not bereav the being of Religious duties or their calings, no more then lapſes after Baptiſm doo unbaptiſe any Chriſtian. Wherher Biſhops ordeined Presbyters by divine Apoſtolic right; or exerciſed Ordination, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Juriſdiction only by eccleſiaſtic cuſtom in order of place among Presbyters? it needs no curious debat: But certes tru Epiſcopat is every way lawful, and Miniſters regularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined right Paſtors, maugre al Traducers malice or gainſaying.

No Religion bars convenient compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious terms to diſtinguiſh degrees: but theſ word-Carpers hav a malitious meaning, to make People abandon both Name and Thing, even the Office and Ordination. 2. To the demand, what charm is in Biſhops hands or praiers to confer the holy Ghoſt, more then in others ſo wel or better gifted? It may ſo wel be asked (as Atheiſts and Apoſtats uſe) what virtu is in Baptiſm water to waſh away ſin, regenerat ſinners, confer Grace, or repreſent Chriſts blood more then in other, as proud Catabaptiſts conteſted? Or what efficacy in Bread and Wine at the Lords Supper, more then in the ſame Elements at uſual Tables or Taverns? How doth the form of conſecration by uſing Chriſts words ad or alter them? At this rate of carnal reaſoning, Men may cavil at Chriſts Deity and Humanity for the outward poverty of his life and death; which made many doubt or deny him to be the tru Meſſias. So this fond, futilous, frivolous queſtion fals to ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with its own weight or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; as if there, were more light in lat modern Meteors, then in the great Lamps (Sun, Moon, and Stars) of Scripture, Church, and antient Chriſtians: who with the ſame holy humble Faith, as they beleev Jeſus to be the promiſed Meſſias (maugre al which blind Jews and babarous Infidels obtrud) doo alſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly reverence al his holy Orders and Ordinances, how poor or plain ſoever, ſetled in his Church. Nor doth the means of outward appeerance weaken their duty or devotion: who liv by Faith, ſee with the ey of Faith, and act with Faiths hand in al divine myſteries: For God makes fooliſh things effectual by his ſpirit and Grace, to thoſ high holy ends for which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined.

               <p>The reſult is, That Ordination makes nothing to Miniſters
<pb facs="tcp:168435:117"/> Natural, Moral, or Spiritual endowments; nor doth it confer any Phyſical power, no more then the Office of a Judg, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, or martial Commander, to their perſonal abilities: but inveſts them alone with authority to exerciſe thoſ Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which none elſ may preſum to perform, who hath not that order of Office conſigned to him: Nor can any power in Men make a Goſpel Miniſter though never ſo gifted, to conſecrat holy duties, ſav only ſuch as are ſet apart or ſeparat therto by du Ordination. The benefits therof are manifeſt and manifold: 1. For Gods glory and ſalvation of Mens Souls, by beleeving tru Miniſters teſtimony, that Jeſus Chriſt is ſole Saviour of the World; who began this Ordinance, and ſent ſom ſpecial wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to proclaim him by a conſtant continual ſucceſſion in al ages and places til his ſecund coming. 2. It evidenceth the Churches care and fidelity, both in preſerving the divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and in celebrating holy Myſteries as Seals to confirm Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Faith; beſide the exerciſe of wholſom Diſciplin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Churches chief Paſtors and Rulers. 3. It givs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rightly Ordeined a real power derived from Chriſt, which <note place="margin">Mat. 28 20. 1 Tim. 5. 22. 2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> none hath of himſelf; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy, lay hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on none, but commit the things he had heard of him to faithful Men, who ſhal be able to teach others alſo: viz.</hi> by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſucceſſion, and public Commiſſion. 4. It binds the party Ordeined more ſtrictly to diſcharge his duty by ſtudy, praier, conference, meditation to keep and improv thoſ gifts or Graces, for Gods glory and the Churches good. 5. It givs tru Miniſters comfort, courage, and confidence (as ſacred unction did to the Prophets, and Chriſts ſolen Commiſſion to the Apoſtles) to preach; not as popular Scribes, or precarious Phariſees; but as St. <hi>John</hi> Evangeliſt authoriſed by Chriſt; whoſ Miniſtry, like <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts, was not of Men (though tranſmitted by Men) but from Heaven; wherby they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buk with authority, and doo al duties of their Miniſtry. With this confident conſcience, they can ſpeak boldly in the Lords name, not fearing Mens faces, no nor the force or fury of Devils: nor wil forſake their Flocks when Wolfs com, as Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Self-Intruders doo; but in times of public perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, chuſ rather to be exemples of cheerful ſuffering, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168435:117"/> of Chriſts promiſed aſſiſtance and reward. 5. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervs order and decorum in the Church, fortifying their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with du reſpect or regard: ſo that neither Perſon nor Office is eaſily deſpiſed, when divine Ordination is duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. For it conciliats much lov, aw, and reverence from al tru Chriſtians; raiſing a juſt vencration to duties rightly celebrated by thoſ of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that receiveth you</hi>

Wheras Chriſt hath three Offices of King, Prieſt, and Prophet; they differ under which to darrain their Diſciplin.

To this they al ſtick as limpets to aſtone, but diſſent in particular points of the foundation. <hi>Cartwright</hi> confines Chriſt as Son of God coequal with the Father to be Ruler of Civil Stats; but not as our Saviour or Redeemer: the Humble Motioner ſaith he hath power over al Principalities in Heaven and Earth, not ſimply as ſecund Perſon, but as Son of God Manifeſted in the Fleſh; having ſole authority not only as God and Man, but as meer Man. <hi>Cartwright</hi> conteſts, that Chriſt in governing ſecular Stats hath no Superior: the Motioner ſaith, As he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords; he receivs this power of the Father: to whom <hi>Beza</hi> aſſents, that God governs the World in perſon of his Son as made Man; and al power given him in Heaven and Earth is ſpoken properly of his Humanity.

His ſufferings from the Cratch to the Croſſ are infinit and inexpreſſible; his whol life being a perpetual paſſion: he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled yea emptied himſelf to becom Man, ſuffering more herein then al Men can: for if Man ſhould be turned into a Beaſt (as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> dreamed) into duſt, into nothing, 'tis no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement,
<pb facs="tcp:168435:128"/> as God to be made Man. What Man? if Monarch of the World to tread on Kings necks, trampling al Crowns and Scepters under feet, it had bin ſom port or pomp: but he cam in form of a Servant, and becam the contempt of Men, yea a worm and no Man; the ſhame of Men and ſcorn of the multitud. He was born in a Stable, cradled in a Cratch or Manger, caried a Child into <hi>Egypt</hi> to avoid <hi>Herods</hi> butchery, baſely bred in his Foſter-Fathers Cotage, lived poorly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, endured al extremities of hunger, thirſt, cold, and other calamities during minority: but coming to Virility and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of his Deity, he was tranſported and tempted by Satan, derided of his Kindred, traduced by the Jews, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Elders and Phariſees; reſtleſſ, harborleſſ, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſ: ſold by his own ſervant, apprehended, arraigned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, crucified: But wher? not in a corner; but at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Ey and Heart of the World, wher he wrought a world of Wonders: Wherabout? in <hi>Calvary</hi> among ſtinking ſculs and execrable Malefactors. When? At the Paſſover, wher Proſelits reſorted from al parts to receiv the type, and reject the arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type: who inſtead of eating the Paſchal Lamb, ſlu and ſacrificed the tru Paſſover. With whom? Betwixt two Theefs. He that thought it no robbery to be equal with God, is made equal to Robbers. What ſuffred he? A curſed, lingring, tormenting, ignominious death, even on the Croſſ, being made a curſ for us: a curſ worſ then the ſhame, but both worſ then the pain, and ſcorn worſt of al. His Croſſ-Companions, had no irriſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or inſultation over them, but death only: he death with diſdain, diſgrace, and deriſion; the Jews, Souldiers, and Theefs twitted or triumphed over him. Al his ſenſes were windows to let in ſorows: his Eys beheld the tears of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mother and Friends, with manifold deſpits of his Foes: his Ears heard the blaſphemous railings and revilings of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud: His Noſtrils ſmelt the noiſom ſent of dead Mens bones: His Touch felt the nails: His Taſt bitter Gal: Was ever ſorow like his ſorow? That Head which Angels adored, is harowed with thorns: That face fairer then the Children of Men, is ſmeared with filthy ſpittle and furrowed with tears: Thoſ Eys brighter then the Sun, are ſhadowed with death: Thoſ Ears
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168435:128"/> inured to heavenly Harmony, are filled with ſcofs and ſcorns: Thoſ Lips that ſpake as never Man did, are wet with Gal and Vineger: Thoſ hands which ſwaied Heavens Scepter, cary the Reed of reproch, and are faſtned to the Tree: Thoſ Feet to which al powers of Hel were a Foot-ſtool, are nailed to the Foot-ſtool of the Croſſ: That whol Body conceived by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, is ſcourged, wounded, mangled: yet al this but the outſide of his ſufferings: but the innner part or Soul of his pains, is ſo far beyond thoſ ſenſitiv torments, as the Soul ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the Body, or Gods wrath Mans malice. What the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit ſins of innumerable Men, committed againſt an infinit Majeſty, deſerved in infinit durance; al this he in a ſhort ſpace of his Paſſion ſuffred or ſuſteined; which made him cry, <hi>My God, my God, why dooſt thou forſake me?</hi> he was affrighted with terrors, perplexed with griefs, diſtraught with both. It was not ſo much for millions of Men to deſpair, as for him to fear: yet never was any ſo afraid of Hel, as he of his Fathers wrath for our ſins and in our ſteads. Thus his Incarnation, Nativity, Birth place, Life, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcention, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Gods right hand; with many mo circumſtanees of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> treaſon, and reward, the Jews rejecting him, and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Theefs; were al divinely foretold of the Meſſias to com, and directly fulfilled in or by Chriſt, to whom only they fitly and fully agree: For he is <hi>the Womans Seed which ſhould break the Serpents head, and in whom al Nations of the Earth ſhal be bleſſed.</hi> The other teſtimonies touching the time and truth of Meſſias coming; that he ſhal be of <hi>Davids</hi> linage, born of a pure Virgin, perfect God and Man; yea a Spiritual eternal King (no Temporal or Terreſtrial) make up a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to convince the Jews, that Jeſus Chriſt is the only tru forepromiſed Meſſiah: to whom be rendred al Glory, Honor, Praiſ, and Power for ever. Al which might be infinitly inlarged, but for brevity omitted.</p>

I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for thy offenſ, but can finde none, no not any guile in thy mouth: thy Enemies are chalenged, and none dare rebuke thee of ſin: the Officers ſent to apprehend thee teſtify, <hi>That never Man ſpak like thee:</hi> thy ſuborned Accuſers agree not in their witnes; the Judg publicly cleered thy Innocence: his wife warned him by a dream, that thou was't a juſt Man, and he ſhould doo no injuſtice to thee: the Centurion confeſſed thee of a truth to be <hi>the Son of God:</hi> the Theef hanging with thee, juſtified thee to hav doon nothing amiſſ. What then Lord is the cauſ of thy cruel ignominy, paſſion, and death? 'Tis I am the cauſ of thy ſorows, my ſins of thy ſhame, my iniquities of al thy ſufferings.

The luſt of my fleſh provoked thee to wrath, O let his chaſtity procure thy Mercy: that as my pollution ſeduced me to fal, ſo his purenes may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to thy favour. My diſobedience deſervs ſharp revenge, but his obedience merits much more Mercy: for what can Man deſerv to ſuffer, which God that made Man cannot merit to be forgiven?

<pb facs="tcp:168435:133"/> Chriſt. Here obſery, That <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſts firſt forefather after <note place="margin">Notae.</note> the fleſh, is caled Gods Son by Regeneration ſo wel as Creation: for as at beginning <hi>Adam</hi> Gods Son is Chriſts firſt carnal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo at Chriſt end Gods eternal Son becam the Son of Man. A marvelous mutation, that Man made by God, ſhould becom Father to him, who being God, was made Man, to make Men the Sons of God. Lo, what a binding ſtone the Lord Jeſus is, which knits together not only Man with Man (Jews and Gentils) but Man with God: not by perſonal union proper ſoly to himſelf; but ſpiritual communion common to al the Faithful. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev <hi>Adam</hi> was a tru Man, yet not begot by Man, nor born of Woman, but formed by God of the Virgin Earth, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> cals it: And <hi>Eve</hi> a very Woman, yet had no Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but made of <hi>Adams</hi> rib. Why then, can any doubt that Chriſt was a tru Man, though not begot by Man, but framed of <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed in the Virgins womb by the holy Ghoſt? for 'tis fit ſith the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was moulded by Gods hand, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund ſhould be made by the ſame, without Mans concurrence; that he might hav a ſemblance or ſimilitud of production like the firſt. Thus Gods Son becam the Son of Man, of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Abram,</hi> of <hi>Adam:</hi> why then doo we not beleev that the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abram</hi> folowing the Adoption ſhal becom the Sons of God? For 'tis ſtranger that God ſhould be made Man in ſhape of a Servant, to ſuffer death on Earth; then that Man ſhal be exalted to reign in Heaven: yet the firſt is doon; why then doth any diffide of the laſt, ſith he died not in vain?</p>

To comfort poor penitent Sinners: for Chriſt cam not as a Judg to chaſtiſe Mens miſdeeds, but a Phiſition to cure our maladies; who aſſumed our Nature to clenſ us from ſin. 3. To ſet forth Chriſts great Glory, who took no holines from his Anceſtors; for if they al had excelled in piety, it had bin litle for him to be holy: but diſcending from ſinners yet born ſinleſſ; he is manifeſted to be <hi>the chief high Prieſt, holy,</hi>

Which is reſolved, that the Jews provided if a Man died Iſſuleſſ, his Brother or next Kinſman muſt marry his Wife to raiſ up ſeed. Now <hi>Solomons</hi> race ended in <hi>Jeconiah</hi> the <note place="margin">1 Chron. 3. 17.</note> eighteenth after him; who died Childleſſ, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> foretold: yet 'tis ſaid he had Sons, meaning Succeſſors. For <hi>Salathiel</hi> Son to <hi>Neri</hi> ſteps in as Heir, ſtiled by <hi>Matthew Jeconiahs</hi> Son, <hi>viz.</hi> Legal and Regal. For they reckoned a duple deſcent: 1. Natural by direct generation one from another. 2. Legal by collateral ſucceſſion of next Kin. Hence grew the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts ſeveral intentions: <hi>Luke</hi> drawing Chriſts natural line from <hi>David,</hi> to ſhew how he is his Son after the Fleſh: <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the Legal, to ſpecify how for default of <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> Iſſu he ſucceeded in <hi>Davids</hi> throne as tru Heir and King of the Jews rightly ſo caled.

               <hi>Caſar</hi> a forren Conqueror.

            <p>Here mark wel, how as the World waxed elder, Mans life <note place="margin">Note.</note> grew ſhorter; and mo generations multiplied proportionaly in later ages then former. For in 1656. yeers before the Flood fel, were only ten deſcents to <hi>Noah:</hi> in the next 353. to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> (which contains litle more then a fifth part of the firſt ten mo: in the third to <hi>David</hi> (942.) thirteen, which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is far leſſer then the foregoer: in the fourth to the Captivities ſolution (545. yeers) twenty three, which is many
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168435:136"/> mo then any before: in the laſt to Chriſt Nativity (535. yeers) 20. which ſutes neer with the foregoing. Al which make but 77. generations precited, from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund in 4030. yeers complet. Now compare any one race of <note place="margin">Diluvium A.

For if we reckon the Roman Emperors (excluding ſuch as ruled jointly and al Uſurpers) from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> now reigning, ther hav bin 146.

To begin with this Land (which being tributary to <hi>Rome,</hi> had no ſet ſucceſſion of Kings til the Saxons cam) let us compare the Weſt Saxon Kings, from <hi>Cherdic</hi> the Founder (who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred A. 494.) to the <hi>Norman</hi> conqueſt A. 1066. we ſhal find 36. ſucceſſors in 571. yeers: and from the Conqueſt to King Charls decollation (in 582. yeers) 25. mo; in al 61. to which if 56. Emperors from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> (in whoſ time <hi>Cherdic</hi> intruded) be ſupplied, al make 117. ſince Chriſts birth. In <hi>France</hi> from the founder <hi>Pharamond</hi> (who entred A. 520.) to this preſent, ſucceded 63. Kings in 1134. yeers: ſo allowing 57. Emperors from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Leo Iſaurius</hi> when <hi>Pharamond</hi> initiated for the ſaid 520. yeers preceding; it computs 120. Monarchs ſince Chriſt til now, hence it appeers, that in the old Worlds 1656. yeers were only ten deſcents; but in theſ laſt hav bin in <hi>France</hi> 120. which is twelv times ten: and in <hi>England</hi> litle leſſ, according to the preſcribed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of computation. If reference could be made in privat families, the caſe would be cleerer.</p>
            <p>One obſtacle occurs, how in the elder age of 353. yeers from <note place="margin">Doubt.</note> the Flood to <hi>Abram</hi> be ten generations, and in the younger to <hi>David</hi> of 942. yeers (which is almoſt triple the time) but

            <p>This is a Gordian knot hard to unty: for either we muſt <note place="margin">Reſolut.</note> ſuppoſe the Evangeliſts balked ſom deſcents, or that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived imperfect mutilat pedigrees, or conceled ſom links for ſecret ends; or that their Tranſcribers (which is too uſual) committed ſom ſlips; or laſtly that ther were <hi>revera</hi> but 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> generations from <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>David</hi> in 942. yeers, which is ſcarſ probable or credible: wherin let deep Divines dive deep to attain the myſtery, which 'tis not ſafe for Scioliſts to eſſay, leſt they ſink in ſtead of ſwimming, and drench themſelfs.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> in a prolix Preface to the German Divines <hi>Clavis,</hi> hath prefixed an ample Analyſis, which is abundantly abridged, and annexed for variety of wit. The Title tels, that the Book <note place="margin">Ch. 1. v. 1.</note> is a Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Subject-matter, ſith the ſole ſcope is to make him manifeſt. This Title contains three things: 1. the Author God, who gav it to Chriſt: 2. The uſe for which he gav it, to ſhew his Servants the things that ſhal ſhortly befal.: 3. The means by which Chriſts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation is put forth to this uſe. 1. He ſent and ſignified <note place="margin">Ibid v. 2. 3. &amp;c.</note> it by an Angel to <hi>John:</hi> 2. The Preface directs either generaly to al Churches that bear record of Gods Word and Teſtimony of Jeſus, and al things he ſaw; which wil make them bleſſed that read, hear, and keep the ſame: or ſpecialy to the ſeven Aſian Churches of Jeſus Chriſt: who is deſcribed: 1. By the properties or effects of his firſt coming in the Fleſh, who is the faithful Witnes and firſt begotten of the dead, Prince of al earthly Kings; which loved us and waſhed our ſins in his Blood; making us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father: 2. By the properties and effects of his ſecund coming with Clouds: when every Ey (even thoſ that pierced him) ſhal ſee him, and al Kindreds wail becauſ of him. 3.

The effects which it wrought in <hi>John,</hi> who was ready to worſhip the Angel, but bid to forbear: 3. The command which he had not to ſeal the Prophecies, with the reaſon of it: 4. The authority therof is repeated, becauſ Jeſus ſent his Angels to teſtify theſ things in the Churches; becauſ 'tis ratified by the Spirit, Bride, and al Beleevers; becauſ the perfection is ſuch, as no thing may be added or ſubtracted on pain of eternal

                  <hi>a mighty Angel cam from Heaven clothed with a Cloud, a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow on his Head, his Face as the Sun, and Feet pillars of Fire. He had in his hand a little Book open; who ſet his right foot on the Sea, and left on Earth; crying loud, as when a lyon roars, and ſeven thunders uttered their voices. John was about to write it; but a voice from Heaven ſaid, ſeal up theſ things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write not. Then the Angel lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand to Heaven, and ſwore by him that livs for ever; that Time ſhal be no more: But in the dais of the ſeventh Angels voice, when he ſhal begin to ſound; the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, as he declared to his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> The ſound of this ſeventh Trumpet ſhould ſucced the ſixth, but is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded by the litle Book intervening: yet leſt ought be omitted in the interim to fulfil the Prophecy of Seals; the holy.

For tribut is a Symbol of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and under that notion moſt Provinces paid a tenth of other fruits to the Empire. Howbeit this expoſition is not altogether authentic: for the Word (fel) which refers to the Earthquake, implies <hi>Babylons</hi> ruin rather then loſſ of Tributs or Tiths: therfore a tenth part of the City, intends a tru tenth:
<pb facs="tcp:168435:161"/> yet not any part as 'tis at this day; but whol Pontifical <hi>Rome,</hi> which is only a tenth of the old Imperial, as it was in St. <hi>Johns</hi> dais. For <hi>Lypſius</hi> a curious Critic ſaith it was almoſt circular; the ſemidiameter from the golden Pillar in the Mercat place, to the utmoſt buildings being reckoned ſeven miles, and whol compas of that ſemidiameter 42. whence he demonſtrats al the plot to be 126. but <hi>Rome</hi> now only 13. in circuit, which is a tenth part of what it was then. For explaning wherof he ſets a ſexangular Schem which he that liſts may ſurvey. <hi>Rome</hi> was VValled by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> 1. and <hi>Leo</hi> 4. much whereof is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and no Suburbs: but the old extended every way with continued buildings. If this ſenſ be taken, a tru tenth part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained at time of the Earthquake; the other nine being falen long before. For partly by Barbarians often ſackings, partly by devouring time, partly by thunderbolts, partly by fire and other caſualties; but ſpecialy by the Empires decay or deſolation; a tenth part only was fataly reſerved to the Pope, who was to be Head of the new Empire, and Mother of Chriſtian Harlots: but this left muſt by the Earthquakes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, and witneſſes reſurgence be quit demoliſhed. Yet haply a tenth part is not ſo ſtrictly taken by Geometric rules: <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 13.</note> but as God ſaid to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſtruction, a tenth ſhal remain and return, which was not exactly ſo. The ſeven thouſand ſlain in the Earthquake, are not counted by pole; for they ſeem far too few for the great deſtruction intimated elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wher: but by the City buildings.

Mount Sion was <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdoms Throne or Roial manſion, caled his City: becauſ he got it from the <hi>Jebuſits,</hi> and walling it built a Tower, Streets, and Courts. It may here parabolicaly imply that part of the Earth, which Chriſt having vanquiſhd made his Churches habitation; <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian World: wher ſhe keeps hir faith and chaſtity undefiled, when the Beaſt polluted al with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and ſlaughters. The name Lamb is left out in moſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bibles, and his Fathers only inſerted: but the beſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hav both, and the matter requires to read it ſo. For the alluſion to mark Servants and Souldiers, belongs to the Lambs folowers; that they ſhould bear his name ſo wel as his Fathers
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:168435:170"/> in their foreheads at Baptiſm being ſigned with the Croſſ. At which time they giv faith (perſonaly or by Sureties) to renounce Satan and al his works and worſhip: which in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptic phraſe is to abandon the Dragon and his power, with al his Angels or Devils. In this Sacrament we ſolenly profes faith to the Lamb and his Father: for 'tis the Lords Seal, as the Antients cal it. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, let us bear the immortal laver in our forheads: which when the Devils ſhal ſee they tremble. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> terms it the Roial mark of our Redeemer: which Seal is defaced or obliterated by Idolatrous ſuperſtition, as <hi>Tertullian, Iſodor,</hi> and many mo teach or teſtify. The Perſons <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 4.</note> ſealed both before and here are the ſame: but the reaſon for the end of ſealing different: for ther the matter of protection is treated, here of fealty: yet 'tis needleſſ to ſeek another Seal beſide Baptiſm, which performs both: becauſ with it God ads his Grace, wherby he owns them as his, and takes them into tuition: the one is handled in the other Viſion of the ſealed, the other in this. Hence <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> cals Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm a perfect ſafeguard, and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> a ſeal. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, unles the Angel take notice of thy mark, how ſhal he fight or defend thee from the Enemy? hereby ſaith <hi>Nicetas,</hi> we are kept ſafe from Satans ſnares. Thus Baptiſm is the ſeal, and ſign of the Croſſ the mark of the Lamb, as al agree.</p>

The ſeven Phials are ſo many degrees of its ruin: for as the Beaſt gradualy grew up; ſo he is to be deſtroied by degrees. 3.

Soul-Demons or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals Deified after death, are like Saints whom Papiſts adore, and their Images as Heathen Idols: but the other Numens (Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Moon) parallel to Angels. The Gentils plead or pretend they worſhip not ſtocks and ſtones, the works of their own hands, but the Heroes or Souls in them; as the Iſraelits adored God in the golden Calf. So Papiſts aſſume the ſame Apology for Iconolatry: that they worſhip not the Image, but thing repreſented.</p>

               <p>This is a poor palliativ plaſter, but both are Idolatry of the ſame bran.

So three times and half, fourty two months, and one thouſand two hundred ſixty dais being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal or conſignificant, begin and end together: as the Beaſts three times and half commence with the Womans.

That the 6000. yeers of the Worlds durance from the Creation (equivalent to the ſix dais works, every day 1000. yeers) expire next yeer 1655. which he ſtrangely ſtrivs and ſtrains to juſtify: but that Rabinical prediction is a frivolous fiction, and his computation a ridiculous diſtortion; for that 6000. yeers fals ſhort A. 1655. about 315. yeers by the beſt accompt. 3.

So it lay long buried in obſcurity or oblivion, til ſom late Anabaptiſts and Independents their Allies raked it out of grav. Howbeit al Proteſtants rejected it ſince revicton, til <hi>Alſted</hi> returning from <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> renewed ſom parts of this poiſon; which <hi>Piſcator</hi> (a Man more heady and humorous then judicious) ſwalowed: but they diſagree in diverſ points, as Sectiſts uſe to doo. Theſ laid the foundation, but Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> advanced the main fabric: which Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his <hi>London</hi> Lectures on <hi>Hoſea,</hi> preſſed as a moſt comfortable Article of Chriſtian Religion, to be inſtilled into the hearts of al tru Beleevers. Sundry other Sectators publiſhed or proclamed it with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets: who like Presbyterians, (which wherever they find Elders named, think it rings a peal for their motly Diſciplin) wreſt the one thouſand yeers mentioned by <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to Chriſts millenar reign in perſon on Earth before or at the general Judgment, ſtraining Scriptures to ſerv their turn.</p>

               <hi>Cerinthus</hi> to juſtify his invention, fathered it on St. <hi>John;</hi> as <note place="margin">Fiction.</note> if Chriſt whiſpered it to his beſt beloved Diſciple, not to be divulged for an Apoſtolic Tradition: nor is it probable, that if <hi>John</hi> received it as a ſecret, he would revele it to that vile Heretic; whom he ſo hated, that ſeing him com into a public Bath inſtantly left it, bidding his Diſciples com off, leſt the houſ fal on them: which befel accordingly on <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and his folowers with ſom others, cruſhing them to death. That <hi>John</hi> imparted it to him, is a fond fiction: but whether he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it in the Apocalypſ a grand queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Chiliaſts teach, that Chriſt in his Human glory ſhal <note place="margin">Poſitions.</note> com from Heaven into <hi>Paleſtin</hi> (ſom ſay A. 1655. now at hand, or 1695. at fartheſt) wher the Jews from al parts ſhal reſort to rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and folow him as the tru Meſſiah: who is to reign with al his Martyrs and ſom ſelect Saints raiſed from death, one thouſand yeers before the general Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. During which <hi>Millenium,</hi> he ſhal go in perſon to ſubdu al ſtubborn Nations, except a few lurking in corners. Then ſhal the Church of convert Jews and Gentils liv peacably from any Enemy and free from ſin: without the Word, Sacraments, or other Ordinances in al Worldly delights; eating, drinking, getting Children, and enjoying al lawful pleaſures, til thoſ yeers expire, at end wherof the Infidels remaining in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Troops, ſhal beſiege new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but Chriſt with fire from Heaven ſhal deſtroy them al, and immediatly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the laſt Judgment at general Reſurrection of good and bad, according to their works. Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ <note place="margin">Chap. 37.</note> cald <hi>Moſes choice</hi> ſpeaks thus: If the opinion be tru (which I dare not deny) of Chriſts coming to reign a thouſand yeers on this Earth before the laſt Day, ther are riches of glory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Saints here: els cannot I expound many places of Scripture, ſpecialy <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5, 6, 7. <hi>The reſt of the dead li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not again til the thouſand yeers were finiſhed; which is the firſt Reſurrection: bleſſed and holy is he which hath part therin, on ſuch the ſecund death hath no power: but they ſhal be Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, to reign with him a thouſand yeers:</hi> this is uſualy interpreted of riſing from ſin to Grace, and reigning with Chriſt for ever in Heaven: but cannot be the true meaning;

               <hi>Peters</hi> words are directed as an apt anſwer to Scoffers, who inſtantly ads: <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſſ (ac Men count ſlacknes) but long ſuffering to us ward, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould periſh; but that al ſhould repent.

               <p>1. That the old Hebrew (the Scriptures language) hath
<pb facs="tcp:168435:213"/> no one word to expreſſ the univerſ of ſuperior and inferior Bodies (caled in Greec <hi>Coſmos,</hi> in Latin <hi>Mundus,</hi> in Engliſh World) but Heaven and Earth jointly: ſo when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (the World then being periſhed by water; but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth now are reſerved to fire) he might convertibly utter, the Heavens and Earth then periſhed by water, as the World now ſhal by fire: ſo a new Heaven and Earth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notion imply a new World.</p>
               <p>2. That no other World or Heaven and Earth ſhal periſh by fire; then what before periſhd by water, as the antitheſis argues: which is the ſublunar, whoſ Heaven is Air, and Earth the whol Geographic Globe: both which were vitiated or defiled by the deluge, and the Creatures deſtroied or much depraved. Such a World then and no other Heaven or Earth ſhal ſuffer a ſecund flood of Fire for reſtauration, as it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a deluge of Waters for corruption. This is a witty novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as ther be ſundry ſuch now adais) but ſcarſ Orthodox: ſith 'tis a Catholic Tenet, that the Ethereal Heavens with al their Starry hoſt ſhal be burnt up.</p>
               <p>3. That the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (tranſlated Elements) is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Heaven and Earth ther named; becauſ Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven includs Air, and Earth Water: ſo three Phyſical Elements are implied, and Fire (if it be a fourth, or not rather a quality of intenſ heat inherent in another Body) muſt burn the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and can be none of that to be burnt. So it muſt be rendred the whol Hoſt of them, or Furniture belonging to them, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies the works or Hoſt of the Earth which ſhal be burnt. <note place="margin">Gen 2. 1.</note> For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heavens and Earth were finiſhed, with al the Hoſt of them,</hi> which the Septuagints ſtile Furniture. So the meaning is, the Heavens and Hoſt therof, with the Earth and works or Furniture therin ſhal be fired. The Scripture ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies three Heavens: 1. Empyreal of Glory, whoſ Hoſt or Army are inviſible Angels and bleſſed Spirits. 2. Ethereal or Starry, whoſ Hoſt are ſhining Stars and Planets. 3. Aereal or Sublunary, whoſ Hoſt are either viſible as Meteors and Fowls; or inviſible, as evil Spirits and Fiends, with their Prince of the Air Satan the Devil. To apply it: St. <hi>Peter</hi> cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Empyreal, which is increat and impaſſible; nor Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168435:213"/> which is of vaſt immenſity and ſublimity, in regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this lower world is but a point or Center: nor did thoſ two receiv any curſ for Mans ſin, or contagion or contamination by the Deluge; nor doo any of Gods enimies dwel ther to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file them: So it reſts, That the Aereal only, with al their Hoſt, ſhal be burnt up at laſt day. Theſ Heavens then ſhal melt with fervent heat, being a metaphor taken from refining Metals, which is his meaning: who expounds diſſolving by melting or purifying, as the Septuagints ſtil interpret that word by refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but when the Aereal is ſo refined, the Ethereal Lights wil ſhine to them on Earth far more glorious, as paſſing their rais through a purer <hi>medium;</hi> ſo that the world ſhal ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. As to the word (paſſing away) 'tis an Hebraiſm ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying any change of a thing from the old Eſtate: ſo al imply a ſeceſſion from their priſtin condition; but no utter abolition by Fire, more then the former deſtruction by Water. If any ask, whether the Hoſt of inviſible Spirits ſhal ſuffer by it?

Chriſt ſpeaks of eating and drinking at his Table Tropicaly (as al ſober Orthodox agree) deriving it from his laſt Supper, which he newly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted before thoſ words were uttered: ſignifying the effect of it, that therby they ſhal participat eternal life in his Heavenly Kingdom, not at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a thouſand yeers before the Judgment, as common Chiliaſts conceiv; nor after it for

               <hi>bondage, into the glorious liberty of Gods Children: for the whol Creation grones and travels in pain together til now and not only they, but we alſo which hav the firſt fruits of the Spirit: even we groan within, waiting for the adoption, to wit redemption of our body: Ergo</hi> al Creatures ſhal be reſtored.</p>

'Tis moſt abſtruſe of any in the new Teſtament as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> avers: wherto many apply St. <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>That in Pauls Epiſtles ſom things are hard</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>to underſtand, which the unlearned and unſtable wreſt (as they doo other Scriptures) to their own deſtruction.</hi> 'Tis a good cavest for bold Buzzards, not to build doubtful doctrins on dark O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles without good guids, unles they be found or founded on Faiths analogy elſwher. The firſt words <hi>(The Creatur ſhal be delivered from Corruptions bondage)</hi> may beſt be doon by annil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, being therby freed from Mens abuſes, and farther poſſibility of decay; tho not reſtored to perfecter eſtate, as the letter ſeems to ſay. The next <hi>(Into the glorious liberty of Gods Children)</hi> may be ſafly expounded together with their liberty, or by reaſon of it, or at ſame time with it. So St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> beſt skild in his Mother toung, interprets the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticl <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (together, for, or by reaſon of) that they ſhal be freed by means of the Saints liberty. Semblably St. <hi>Ambroſ</hi> ſaith, it ſhal be at the ſame time together, when the Saints ſhal attain their glory: which two Expoſitions ſeem ſoundeſt to ſalv al ſcruples. For dumb Creatures cannot be coheirs with the elect of eternal bliſſ, by redemption or reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body (as the bare words imply) having no ſaving faith in Chriſt. Thoſ words <hi>(Not only they, but even we which hav the firſt fruits of the Spirit, groan within our ſelfs, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our body)</hi> plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwen the Saints ſtate, who groan and wait for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Body: and al other Creatures, which groan only to be delivered from corruptions bondage, together with
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168435:220"/> the liberty of Gods Children, or at the ſame time, or by means of it. Which deliverance may beſt be atchived by a total final abolition, when they ſhal no more be ſubject to ſlavery, abuſe, and villany. This cleerly reſolvs al difficulty, to interpret the particile (into) by together with the liberty of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; according to thoſ two orthodox Fathers authentic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Such as aſſert any other liberty of reſtauration or melioration, muſt anſwer al foregoing Arguments for anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation; or ſhew ſufficient cauſ why ſom ſhal be reſtored and not al: ſith St. <hi>Paul</hi> names the whol Creation or every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Kinds and Individuals. To ſay, Mixtils, Vegetals, and Bruts ſhal partake the glorious liberty of eternal felicity with Gods Sons or Saints; is a Brutiſh buz which no ſound ſober Divines dare own. He uſeth the phraſe of delivery from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption rather then annihilation, as parrallel to Mans manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from like bondage. <hi>Marlorat</hi> (who is for reſtitution) comments thus: hence it appeers, into how great glory Gods Sons ſhal be exalted, ſith for their ſakes al Creatures ſhal be renewed with them, as they were curſed for Mans fal and fault. Yet ſhal they not partake the ſame meaſure of glory; but a better condition after every capacity: yet what that ſhal be in Inanimats, Plants, and Beaſts is curioſity to inquire; ſith the chief part or pitch of corruption is annillation. This implies that they may be freed from bondage of corruption (not ſimply from corruption, as Regenerats are releaſed from ſins reign) by utter abolition, which he cals a cheif part or pitch of corruption: but renovation is the Acme of perfection. Now if the Text be taken literaly, how can mute Creatures groan or travel in pain? But ſay 'tis meant Metaphoricaly of their Natural appetit to be freed from bondage: yet how can they enjoy a like liberty of Gods Sons for whom Chriſt died? Or grant too, that no identity is intended, but only an analogical proportion by exemplar reſemblance: yet how can they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a redemption of the Body, which having bin the Souls receptacle here, ſhal be reunited to it for ever? <hi>'Tis ſown a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 23.</note> 
               <hi>corruptible Body, raiſed incorruptible: ſown in diſhonor, raiſed in glory: ſown in weaknes, and riſeth in power.</hi> Which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough for reſtitution of Human Bodies: but al Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:168435:221"/> elſ being compact of the common Chaos (which was made of meer nothing) ſhal probably revert to nothing: this ſeems to ſute beſt with Faiths analogy and Scriptures harmony, which tends more to utter abolition then reſtitution or ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for al at laſt day ſhal be delivered from corruptions bondage, when Gods ſons ſhal be, and for their ſakes; tho the maner diametraly differ: <hi>viz.</hi> the one by Redemption of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other by deletion of the whol ſubſtance. So ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſ,</hi> the Creature travelling in pain, hath this comfort, that it ſhal reſt from labor for ever, when al ſhal beleev, whom God knows are to beleev. Howbeit if it be granted, that al ſhal be Individualy raiſed, yet it folows not that a finit containing World ſhal be reſtored, or new created: but rather al turned to infinity (ſo wel as time to Eternity) for ſuch infinity of Creatures, as hath bin ſince the World began. In brief, St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends the time when they ſhal be delivered, not the <hi>terminus</hi> or thing into like liberty with the Saints.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion is very difficil to decide by Scripture; nor is <note place="margin">Percloſe.</note> defined by any Synod, nor any Article of ſalvific Faith. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> declines the deciſion; but ſaith ſom points are plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20, 21.</note> which muſt be beleeved: as that al Creatures are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to vanity for mans ſin, that al ſhal be delivered from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage <note place="margin">2. Pet. 12. 13.</note> of corruption into the glorious liberty of Gods Sons, or rather for and together with it, that good Angels ſhal abide with the Saints: that the Elect ſhal enjoy eternal glory with Chriſt: that the created Heavens, Elements, and works ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhal be burnt up: that a new Heaven and Earth muſt be expected, wherin dwels righteouſneſ: but other clauſes; how dumb Creatures ſhal partak the liberty of Gods Children? whether by renovation, or abolition? How many ſorts of Creatures ſhal be releaſed? Whether al, a few, or none? How Heaven and Earth ſhal be diſſolved by fire? whether as Gold is refined, or utterly annilled, being of no farther uſe? what manner of fire it ſhal be, material or immaterial? what ſhal be the condition, uſe, place, quantity, quality, glory of the new Heaven and Earth, if any ſuch ſhal be? Al which with other like Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith tis better to leav hid in doubt, then litigat about incertanties; ſith they may be debated with
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:168435:221"/> danger, but left in ſuſpenſ ſans harm or hazard: he holds that al ſcruples are ſafeſt ſatisfied by annihilation: that the fire ſhal be material, as the old world was drowned by ordinary water: ſo ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi> and moſt School-men, but on no good grounds: yet al agree, it ſhal not work as a natural Agent, but divine Inſtrument, to conſume the whol mundan Machin with al things therin, as God eternaly decreed; therfore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovs al to decline the fury of it by turning from our ſins, and returning by repentance to God in Chriſt. Maſter <hi>John Down</hi> a pious Paſtor of <hi>Inſto</hi> (ſororal Nephew to Biſhop <hi>Juel</hi>) had a ſmart bout by Pen with Doctor <hi>Hakewil</hi> his intimat friend, for the worlds renovation; ſpecialy touching the tru ſenſ of that dark precited Text: but in fine approved Annihilation; peruſe it pondrouſly, but I forbear to abridg it for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity.

For he mightily declared himſelf to be the Lord by being born of a pure Virgin, as no meer man ever was, and that is ſo wel to be caled the Lords day; yea he ſelf expreſly cals it his day, <note place="margin">John 8. 56.</note> Semblably in ſuſtaining Gods wrath, for the ſins of the World, he mightily declared himſelf to be the Lord, and the Paſſion day may be ſo ſtiled. Again by aſcending into Heaven in his Apoſtles view, he mightily declared himſelf to be the Lord, and that is alſo the Lords day. 2. Chriſt by his Reſurrection occaſioned the firſt day to be kept holy; whence ſom Writers ſay he changed the Sabbath into that day: not as if he were Author or Inſtitutor, and did actualy ſet it apart to be halow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but only was <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> or occaſion of it: as 'tis ſaid here, the Papiſts made Nov. 5. an holy day, yet the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inacted it. 3.

               <p>That Men after the Reſurrection ſhal liv eternaly in Heaven <note place="margin">Aſcention into Heaven.</note> (caled by St. <hi>Paul</hi> the third Heaven) is not evident in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: by the Kingdom of Heaven is meant Gods Kingdom who dwels in Heaven; which was Iſraels People: whom he ruled by Judges, Prophets, and high Prieſts as Lieftenents, til they rebelled and required a mortal King like other Nations.

               <p>1. By abuſing or aboliſhing the Scriptures Light, for weer <note place="margin">1 Cauſ.</note> not knowing the Scripture: the chief is (wherto almoſt al the reſt are conſequent or ſubſervient) wreſting it to prov Gods Kingdom ſo oft cited, to be the Church or multitud of Chriſtians now living, or that ſhal riſe at laſt day: but the Kingdom of God was firſt erected by <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtry over the Iſraelits (ſo ſaith he, but none elſ) cald his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: which after ceaſed when they refuſed to be longer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by God, and choſe <hi>Saul.</hi> Since which time God had no proper Kingdom by pact or covenant; but only as he ever was, is, and ſhal be, univerſal King of al Creatures; ruling according to his abſolut Wil and infinit Power. Nor are any now under any King or Kingdom by pact (ſav our ſecular Soveraigns) til Chriſt ſhal com again to reign eternaly on Earth. Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneal to this ſaid error is, that Chriſt (now in Heaven) hath ſom one Man or Aſſembly, by whoſ mouth he ſpeaks, givs Laws, and which repreſents his Perſon. This regal power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the Pope claims generaly over al the Church: but in particular ſtats the Paſtors or Presbyteries of thoſ places: which begets ſuch darknes in Mens underſtandings. Hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults another error, that a Chriſtian Kingdom had need to receiv his Crown by a Biſhop: as if the clauſ of <hi>Dei gratia</hi> depended on that Ceremony. So al Eccleſiaſtics aſſume the title of Clergy, caling al others Laity or People ſimply. Hence alſo aroſe the diſtinction betwen Emperors Civil Laws, and Popes Canons: which laſt were but bare Canons or Rules vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily received by Princes, til <hi>Charlemaign</hi> becam Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: but afterward as the Popes power increaſed, becam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Laws, and Emperors allowed them. For the Pope pretending al Chriſtians to be his Subjects, makes it capital for any not to be of Roman Religion: but tolerats Jews, Mahometans, and Pagans to enjoy their own Rites, if they
<pb facs="tcp:168435:250"/> offer no ſcandal. A ſecund abuſe of Scripture is turning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration into conjuration or inchantment: for to conſecrat is to offer, giv, or dedicat decently and devoutly any thing to God; by ſeparating it from common uſe or prophane, to be holy and peculiar for Gods ſervice by his Miniſters hands: but when Papiſts pretend to change the nature or quality of a thing (as in the Lords Supper to make Bread and Wine by ſaying this is my Body, this is my Blood, to be Chriſts very Body and Blood) it muſt either be Gods extraordinary work (which 'tis not being doon daily and frequently) or a vain impious conjuration: wherby they would hav Men beleev a change of Natures contrary to the teſtimony of their ſight and other ſenſes.</p>
               <p>If the Aegyptian Sorcerers (who turnd their Rods to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Waters to Blood, or at leaſt to ſeem ſo) had made no change in ſhew, but only outfaced the King, that they were Serpents which looked like Rods: would not al Men tax them for Liers? Thus Prieſts tel the People, that they hav turned Bread into a Man, nay a God; requiring Men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it, which is groſſ Idolatry. The words (this is my Body, or repreſents my Body) can extend ſoly to the Bread which Chriſt conſecrated with his own hands: for he ſaid not, the Bread wherof any Prieſt ſhal ſay (this is my Body) ſhal be inſtantly tranſubſtantiated into it: nor was this doctrin harched in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> til under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third not 500. yeers ago: when the Popes power was at higheſt, and Peoples darknes heavieſt; that Men could not ſee the Bread they eat, ſpecialy being ſtamped with Chriſts figure on the Croſſ, as if the very wood was tranſubſtantiated, which they ate together with the Body. So at Baptiſm they uſe many Charms in name of the holy Trinity, with the ſign of the Croſſ at naming ech Perſon: as in conſecrating holy Water the Prieſt ſaith, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee Creature of Water in the name of God the Father Almighty, and Jeſus Chriſt his only Son our Lord, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu of the holy Ghoſt; that thou becom conjured Water to driv away al the Enimies powers &amp;c. The like is doon in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of Salt and Hony mixd therwith: but the chief charms are reſerved for the Children to be Baptiſed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168435:250"/> in their Ceremonies. The like are uſed in Mariage, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of the Sick, extrem Unction, conſecrations of Churches and Church-yards to expel Phantaſms, Faieries, and imaginary Spirits: al which belong to the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, being effects of our natural ignorance. Another error is from miſinterpreting the words eternal Life, everlaſting Death, and ſecund Death: of which three in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had an eſtate to liv for ever, not by nature in himſelf <note place="margin">Eternal Life.</note> or any part of his; but by eating the Tree of Life, which he had leav to doo, ſo long as he obeied God: but was thruſt out of Paradiſe ſo ſoon as he ſinned; leſt he ſhould feed theron and liv for ever. Now Chriſts death is a diſcharge of ſin and reſtitution of Life eternal to al the faithful who beleev in him, and to them only. Yet the general doctrin of Divines is, that every Man hath eternal life by nature of his immortal Soul: ſo that the flaming Sword at entrance of Paradiſe, may hinder him from taſting the Tree of Life; but not from immortality which God bereaved. Nor ſhal he need Chriſts ſacrifice for recovery of the ſame: ſith not only the faithful or righteous, but the wicked and Heathen ſhal enjoy eternal Life without Death, much leſſ a ſecund everlaſting death. To ſalv or ſhadow this, they ſay by ſecund everlaſting Death, is meant a ſecund everlaſting Life (but Torments) which is a figure never uſed ſav in this very caſe.</p>
               <p>Is not ſecund Death an eternal being both of Body and <note place="margin">Quaere.</note> Soul in Hel-fire under Satan?</p>
               <p>This tenet of the Souls immortality, is founded on ſom obſcure places of the new Teſtament, which yet in a different ſenſ (of his own mint) are cleer enough, and unneceſſary to Chriſtian Faith. For ſuppoſe when a Man dies nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but his Carcas; cannot God who made clay a living Creature by his word, raiſ it again by another word? Yes, but not to the ſame life, which vaniſhed to nothing: wheras the Soul being immortal perſiſts identical. Soul in Scripture ſtil ſignifies either Life or a Living Creature, and Body jointly with Soul a Body alife. As God ſaith, <hi>Let the Waters produce</hi> Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile animae viventis, <hi>the creeping thing with a living Soul; we tranſlat that hath life:</hi> Again, <hi>God created Whales</hi> &amp; omnem

This Error of ſeparated Eſſences draws on diverſ other abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for if thoſ forms be real, they muſt hav ſom place; but becauſ they hold them incorporeal (they doo not, but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible) ſans dimenſion, and Place muſt be filled with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; they are driven to deviſe a ridiculous diſtinction, that they are in place <hi>Definitive, non circumſcriptive,</hi> when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is the defining or determining of a thing to its place, and ſo both terms of their diſtinction are the ſame. Touching Mans Eſſence (Soul) they ſay 'tis al in the whol, and al in every part: who wil ſwalow ſuch gudgeons or beleev theſ gulleries? Yet they muſt who beleev the real exiſtence of a Soul or Spirit ſeparat from the Body. If it be asked, how a Soul can be tormented with fire being incorporeal? They only

Sith mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is change of place proper only to Bodies; they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to reſolv, how a Soul can go hence to Heaven, Hel, or Purgatory without a Body?

               <p>Why not to vindicat God from being Author of ſin, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <note place="margin">Quaere.</note> his abſolut irreſpectiv Decree to Reprobat men, who muſt needs ſin: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines Good and Evil by mens appetit, which may ſeem tru, ſith every one is ruled by his own liſt or lore; but in a Common-wealth the meaſure is falſ,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168435:258"/> wher not mens privat appetits, but public Law of the State is ſole Rule: yet their doctrin ſoly practiſed, wher every one doth what ſeems good in his own eys. To make lawful mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age unchaſt or impure (as they doo who deny it to the Clergy, under color of continual chaſt continence, to attend at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and adminiſter the holy Euchariſt) is vain Philoſophy: wherby they make mariage a moral vice, and themſelfs by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining ſpiritual, like the Angels in Heaven. From <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Civil Polity, they cal al Common-wealths ſav the popular (ſuch as then <hi>Athens</hi> was) Tyranny, and al Kings Tyrans: ſo they termed thirty Legiſlators ſet up by the Lacedemonians (who ſubdued <hi>Athens</hi>) thirty Tyrans, and Democraty liberty. yet <hi>Tyran</hi> truly taken ſignifies ſimply a Monarch; but when that Government grew odious in all Greece, it was branded with the Popular hatred of Tyranny; and when Kings were expeld from <hi>Rome,</hi> they did the like. So when the ſame men are diſpleaſed with Democraty or Ariſtocraty, they nickname the firſt Anarchy, the laſt Oligarchy or Tyranny of a few. Hence riſeth another error of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> that Laws (not men) ſhould govern: as if men wil be ruled by words or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not by men which hav power by the Sword to puniſh or put them to death, giving life to the Laws: this is a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pernitious error, wherby they ſeduce men ſo oft as they like not their Governors to raiſ war againſt them, which the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy cheriſheth. Another error in Civil Philoſophy (which they never learned of Pagans) is, to extend the Law (the Rule on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of actions) to mens very thoughts and Conſciences, by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or inquiſition of what they hold, tho they conform in Words and Actions. Herby they are forced to anſwer the truth of their thoughts, or an untruth for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Another error (not drawn from Heathens) is, that a privat Man without the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths authority, may interpret the Law by his own Spirit; but are not Scriptures wher they are a Law, made a Law by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealths authority, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a part of the Civil Law? So they which impropriat Preaching to one certain Order of Men, wher the State leavs it free, commit the like error: for if the State forbids me not
<pb facs="tcp:168435:259"/> to Preach, none elſ can. If I be among Judians or Infidels, ſhal I being not in Orders, think it ſin to Preach Chriſt Jeſus, or expound Scriptures? In ſuch caſes of neceſſity (ſay they) wher is no Miniſtry, it may be doon without miſſion: as wherever a diſpenſation is du for neceſſity; ther needs none, when no Law forbids it. <hi>Ergo</hi> to deny theſ functions to whom the civil Soveraign denies them not; is to take away lawful liberty.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmens writings are moſtly inſignificant terms or trains of ſtrange barbarous words, otherwiſe uſed then in common Latin language; which would poſe <hi>Cicero, Varro,</hi> or any Grammarian of antient <hi>Rome.</hi> For let any try whether he can tranſlat them into any modern Toung: which if he cannot, how can that be intelligible in Latin, which is not ſo in other languages? Howbeit this inſignificance of ſpeech is no falſ Philoſophy; but both a quality to hide the truth, and make Men think they hav it being skild in School-notions; and ſo deſiſt from farther ſerch of it in others.

                  <hi>Tully</hi> tels, that one <hi>Caſſius</hi> a Roman Judg, if the Witneſſes could not make cleer a crime; would ask the accuſers <hi>Cui bono,</hi> what profit the Priſoner expected by the fact? For no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſo evidently declares the guilt of an Author, as the gain which he ſhal get by the action. So in the foreſaid caſes it muſt be inquired, what gain, glory, or greatnes accrued to any by holding the ſame? 1. That the Church militant on Earth is Gods Kingdom of glory or Land of Promiſſ (not that of Grace, which is but a Promiſſ of the Land) theſ benefits ariſe to the Clergy: that the Prieſts, Paſtors, or Prelats ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as Gods public Miniſters or Teachers of the People, a right to govern the Church, and conſequently the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, both being the ſame Perſons. Hence the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with al Chriſtian Princes ſubjects to beleev; that to diſobey him in ſpiritual cauſes, was to oppoſe Chriſt himſelf, whoſ Vicar he was as St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: which in effect is to uſurp an univerſal Monarchy over al Chriſtendom. For tho the Chriſtian Emperors at firſt conſtituted them ſuprem teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in al their Dominions under them, by the title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> or cheif Prelat: yet when the Empire was divided and after diſſolved; he eaſily induced People being his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects already, to adore him as Chriſts Viceroy in the Church as his Kingdom of Glory: ſo it may be preſumed, that he
<pb facs="tcp:168435:260"/> having the beſt benefit by this univerſal Monarchy, was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Theory. Afterward, when Princes, Stats, and Churches rejected the Popes univerſal power; the civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns ſhould hav reſerved their right before they let it go; as <hi>England</hi> in effect did: ſav that the Clergy maintaining their function under them to be Gods right; ſeemed to uſurp if not a Supremacy, yet an independence on civil power: yet ſeemed only, acknowledging a right in the King to ſuppreſſ the exerciſe of their function at his pleaſure. Indeed wher the Presbytery prevailed, tho they abandoned many Romiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins; yet this that Chriſts Kingdom is already com, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at his Reſurrection, is ſtil retained. Yea they claim po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to excommunicat Kings as ordinary Sheep of their Fold, and be ſole Moderators in al matters of Religion wher they rule; as the Pope chalengeth it over al Chriſtians. For to excommunicat a Soveraign, is to rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God can doo no wrong, nor ly, nor ſin being contrary to <note place="margin">2 Theſis.</note> his Nature: who is Eſſentialy and Abſtractly Juſtice, Verity, and Goodnes it ſelf. Al that he doth is juſt; but to ſay 'tis al juſt becauſ he doth it, is a pure error: for Juſtice is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Moral virtu, the ſame to God and Man by Nature; nor can God make an unjuſt act juſt becauſ he doth it. A Pope in Conſiſtory having denounced <hi>Fiatur</hi> (which a Cardinal whiſpered was falſ Latin) broke forth furiouſly into theſ words: <hi>in contemptum omnium Grammaticorum Fiatur.</hi> 'Tis not ſo with God, who wil not make an unjuſt thing juſt, nor untruth truth: but if he ſhould Reprobat Men of meer free pleaſure, by abſolut irreſpectiv Decree to ſhew his power, Soveraignty, or Dominion over al his Creatures: it were a
<pb facs="tcp:168435:265"/> flat unjuſt act, which al the water in <hi>Thamis</hi> cannot waſh whit becauſ he did it: but to make Man a free Creature able to ſtand or fal; and foreſeing in his ſimple intelligence who wil embrace the means ordained by him for ſalvation, and who refuſe or reſiſt his Grace: to elect the one, and reject or Reprobat the other; is tru Juſtice mixd with Mercy: which is al that God doth in his Decrees of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>Before Kings converted to Chriſtianity, the Apoſtles held <note place="margin">3 Theſis.</note> al Eccleſiaſtic power in their hands, and after them ſuch as they ordained to ſucced: who appointed others ſubordinat (caled Elders) to preach the Goſpel by impoſition of hands: which imports a giving of the holy Ghoſt or Spirit of God, inabling them with gifts fitting to diſcharge that office: as <hi>Moſes</hi> laid his hands on <hi>Joſisa</hi> being to ſucced him.

               </gap>y be a ſubſtance, it muſt be, either material and corporeal; or immaterial and ſpiritual: but 'tis neither. Som ſay 'tis an imperfect ſubſtance in a middle degree between it and an accident; which is a ſilly ſhift or ſhelter. For an imperfect ſubſtance wil require a new Predicament; and Peripatetics repute Form moſt ſublime, yea the perfection of matter in it ſelf moſt imperfect: but a middle nature betwen both, is a meer <hi>Chimaera</hi> or Catamountain not contained in any Category nor hath it any Entity.</p>
            <p>That Form is no material ſubſtance, theſ Reaſons evince: 1. That which informs the matter (<hi>i.</hi> ſo pierceth into al parts and principles, as to giv ſpecifical eſſence) is not material or corporeal, becauſ one Body cannot penetrat another, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſubſtance matter. 2. Every corporeal thing is of it ſelf quantitativ and diviſible: but a form according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is indiviſible void of quantity. 3. Nothing generable or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, is material or corporeal; ſith matter according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cannot be begot or periſh: but al forms (except Mans Soul) vaniſh or periſh, and new are ingendered. 4. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Conſtitution are diverſ or diſtinct in eſſence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſions, elſ al things generable would be uniform and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal: but if forms be material, they differ not from matter ſav in ſom degrees of ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ety and purity; which ſuffice not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:168435:266"/> to take away uniformity nor diverſity. 5. A form is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or origin of al actions: but if it be material, matter is alſo activ, not purely paſſiv: for it hath that activ virtu from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not elſwher; or elſ cannot be a Principle. That 'tis not an Immaterial ſpiritual ſubſtance, theſ pregnant Arguments prov: 1. Whatever is bred of matters eſſence muſt be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, as what is generated of pure Air is Aerial: but a Form is not material as foreproved, or being Immaterial cannot be bred from the eſſence of matter; nor can Principles be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred one of another. 2. A Form cannot proced from the accidents of matter, ſith no ſubſtance is bred of accidents, nor can a Principle be made of any former Entity; ſith that is the Principle, and Form an accident being framed of accidents. 3. Theſ accidents are either the matters paſſiv power, or illimited quantity, or previous diſpoſitions to receiv a Form: but the two former cannot poſſibly be, ſith they are not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerativ: and the later may concur in the agent to produce a Forms exiſtence; but cannot conduce to the conſtitution of its eſſence being meer Accidents. 4. Forms are not generated of nothing, for thats Creation: <hi>non vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Jovi.</hi> To ſalv this ſcruple, they deviſe diverſ diſguiſed diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: 1. That Forms are in the matter potentialy, not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly: this is a contradiction, they are yet are not, but may be. 2. That they are in their cauſes not realy, but eductivly: this is an Antiphraſe, for their cauſes are in the matter, by which they alſo may be herafter. 3. That they are in it habitualy, as Science is in a Scholar aſleep: this is prepoſterous, ſith Science is actualy in a ſleeping Scholar, tho he doth not exerciſe, nor is habitual inexiſtence oppoſit to actual: but Forms til edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are not actualy in the matter: as the form of Air is not in water til it be turned into it; nor the form of Gold in Earth, til it becom Gold: ſo theſ evaſions are very aſyſtats. 5. Souls are not Spiritual (except Mans) much leſſ inanimat forms: for what ſober Man wil ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>av in a Chymical ſenſ, that ther is any ſubſtantial Spirit in a Stone, Herb, or Beaſt? 6. Every divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſubſtance is material and corporeal; for diviſion folows quantity as an inſeparable companion of matter: but form is diviſible, and no ſpiritual indiviſible ſubſtance. 7. No imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb facs="tcp:168435:267"/> ſubſtance is corruptible: but al forms vaniſh and periſh. 8. Every immaterial ſubſtance is nobler then any material: but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orms be immaterial, 'tis contrary in them, ſith the baſe mater of a dumb Flea is permanent and can not be deſtroied; but the Soul of a Roial Lion vaniſheth to vapor, being no ſpiritual ſubſtance. It reſts then that 'tis an accident or Temperament of qualities, but no ſubſtance, as abundantly foreſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed. This is farther proved by three Parallels: 1. Accidents are generated, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and new produced: ſo are al forms. 2. Accidents are diffuſed through the whol Subject, and penetrat the leaſt particles of matter: ſo doo forms. 3. Accidents depend on the matter for being and producing, nor can ſubſiſt without their Subject, nor depart from one to another: ſo 'tis with al forms except Mans Souls. Now the chief contrary objections ſhal be anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Every ſubſtantial compound conſiſts of matter and form: but al natural Bodies are ſubſtantial compounds: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Compoſition is duple: 1. Of matter and accidents, as al corporeal compounds: 2. Of ſubſtance and ſubſtance, as Man only, who hath a material mortal Body, and a ſpiritual immortal Soul: but al elſ only matter indowed with ſeveral accidents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Whatever actuats, ſpecificats, and givs exiſtence to matter, is a ſubſtance: but the form doth al this: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To actuat is either to giv the matter actual being that it ſhal be a ſubſtance: or to endu it with effectual qualities: in the firſt ſenſ 'tis falſ that a form actuats the matter; ſith 'tis a ſubſtance ſubſiſting of it ſelf together with the form; and is more actuated by the form, then it by the matter: but in the laſt ſenſ 'tis tru, that a form actuats the matter or makes it activ. Yet it folows not that 'tis a ſubſtance, ſith al action and acting power, may proced from the qualities of an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſ: but the matter being indifferent to al forms by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſeveral ſorts of qualities; exiſts in ſuch or ſuch a ſpecies. As a lump of Wax is formed into ſundry ſhapes, and exiſts in form of a Creature by taking a new figure, which is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168435:267"/> ſo the matter ſubſiſts of it ſelf, tho not ſeparat from a form: but exiſts with the form, not by it: yea that alone exiſts of it: ſith forms according to Ariſtotelians depend on it both for eſſence and exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> That from which the matter receivs al activity and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is a ſubſtance: but ſo doth matter from form: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Philoſophers ſeeing matter dul or unable to action, and deeming accidents too weak to giv it; deviſed another nature to be fountain of action which they cal form: but they are deceived in ſo deeming, ſith accidents wil ſuffice to make any natural Body activ, without help of another ſubſtance. As light being ſole form of al lucid Bodies (Sun, Stars, Fire, Carbuncle) illumins al opacous obſcure Bodies. So heat of fire an intenſ quality is its form: cold in water, Earth, Ice, and Winter air, hath the ſame effects to quench fire and condenſat things: yet their forms differ, nor doo depend one on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to work thoſ effects. So the ſiccity of fire and Earth dries up water having diſtinct forms. The like may be ſaid of the humidity in water and air, which works the ſame effects under different forms. In ſemblable ſort water and earth by their gravity deſcend, as fire and air by levity aſcend: yet not by diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring forms, but by diverſ accidents only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> That which eſſentialy diſtinguiſheth one kind from another, is a ſubſtance: ſo doth the form: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Every eſſential diſtinction is not made by a ſubſtance: for accidents (virtu and heat) differ eſſentialy: ſo doo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in their definitions by accidents. For in every Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is a <hi>Genus</hi> (as the common matter) wherin al agree; and a difference conſiſting of accidents to diſtinguiſh that matter. As fire is a ſimple Body moſt hot and light: water a ſimple Body coldeſt and heavy. Here the differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of accidents, yet are eſſential and internal: for as accidents are firſt cauſes of operations, ſo are they of eſſential diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in natural Bodies, and included in their definitions, without any ſubſtantial forms: which plainly provs that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents or temperaments of qualities are forms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> A form hath no degree of more or leſſ, nor is varied: but accidents and their temperaments may be varied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
<pb facs="tcp:168435:268"/> degrees: <hi>Ergo</hi> they cannot be eſſential forms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Major Peripatetic propoſition is falſ: for al forms (of ſimple Bodies, Mixt, and Animat) receiv intenſion and remiſſion of degrees: as when Earth turns to Water, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires diverſ preparations or prediſpoſitions before it becom water: doth then the form of Earth al that while remain firm or unchanged? If not, then 'tis more or leſſ varied. So al Elements concur in mixtion, and continu in mixtils: doo their qualities remain, or forms, or rather both? as appeers at diſſolution, when they return to Elements: yet not in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſ vigor as formerly, but remitted or reduced to harmonical ſymmetry. <hi>Zabarel</hi> ſaith, forms may be varied with change of kind, not elſ: as forms of Elements are ſo changed, not otherwiſe. This is meer obſcurity fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of contradiction: as if the form of water in mixtils be leſſ a form then formerly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtil the waters form: yet cannot be caled water having changed its kind and becom another B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy. Therfore 'tis truer, that Elements forms receiv intenſion and remiſſion: which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation provs them to be accidents not ſubſtances; and when their juſt temperament is taken away, they tranſcend or are tranſmuted into new Kinds. So thoſ are idle queſtions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elements eſſential forms, or integrity in mixtils: of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and corruption in an inſtant; as if a form were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or periſht in a moment, with many mo of like bran. For water is made gradualy in time, by changing its tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament: ſo in mixtils (Stone, Apple, Fleſh) corruption corns by depraving the temperament: which if vitiated beyond the utmoſt degree of proportion, a diſſolution folows by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bonds of union: which is doon by mixture of qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> If the temperament be varied, definitions of things muſt alſo be altered: but they are alwais conſtantly the ſame, til the forms be changed: <hi>Ergo</hi> form is no tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This is Childiſh, for definitions are made of things intire or perfect, and abſtracted by imagination of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: but if things be conſidered as they are in nature, defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be changed as nature varies. Can fading Flowers, rotting Apples, putrifying Fleſh, or ſickly Bodies retain the ſame definitions of ſound? Shal the eſſence be changed by
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168435:268"/> mutation of accidents, and not varied with them? Let ſuch as ſo think feed on corrupt carrion, til they acknowledg ther is one definition of ſound food, another of putrid Fleſh: or let them languiſh ſo long, til they learn to diſtinguiſh betwen <hi>Corpus ſanum, aegrum, &amp; nutrum.</hi> What is ſubſtantial or material in Elements and mixtils, that remains invariable: but al accidental or formal is changed, generated, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by degrees, as temperaments alter: according to which definitions muſt be changed.</p>
            <p>Now touching Souls, ther be three ſorts, Vegetant, Sentient, Intelligent: but for better explication, he premiſeth ſom A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms. 1. Ther be three Principles of Bodies: <hi>viz</hi> two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiv, matter of ſubject, and accidents or qualities; and one tranſmutativ, the contrariety of thoſ accidents or qualities. 2. Matter is al that is ſubſtantial in natural Bodies. 3. Matter is indifferent to receiv al accidents, yet is not ſimply the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or root of al. 4. The origin of accidents and ſubjects is one, <hi>viz.</hi> Creation and concreation. 5. The accidents of matter are duple: 1. Som which immediatly folow its eſſence and coexiſt with it, as paſſiv power, quantity or extenſion, place, and time, or ſucceſſiv duration, of which matter is the fountain: 2. Such as make exiſtence in a ſpecifical kind, as al firſt and ſecund qualities: which doo not inhere primarily by neceſſity of nature, but at the Creators pleaſure to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh kinds. 6. Both theſ qualities are impreſſed immediatly like light in the air, needing no intermediat ſubſtance to unite them. 7. As quantities inhere immediatly in the matter: ſo the operations and powers of working flow directly from the qualities. 8. Al firſt qualities (light, heat, cold, humidity, ſiccity) and ſundry of the ſecund (thicknes, thinnes, heavines, lightnes, fluidnes, firmnes) exiſted the firſt day of Creation. 9. The material ſubſtance of Heaven (wherof Philoſophers know little) is common with inferior Bodies, being made of one chaos: ſo are the firſt accidents; but thoſ of the ſecund ſort differ, by the diſcrepant conjunction of firſt and ſecund qualities. 10. Ther be three Elements (Air, Water, Earth) needful to mixtion, and haply two wil ſerv. 11. Theſ Elements eſſentialy differ in their proper qualities given by God: in the Earth are conjoined cold, ſiccity, denſity, gravity, conſiſtence:
<pb facs="tcp:168435:269"/> in the water cold, moiſture, remiſſer denſity, gravity, fluidnes: in the Air remiſſ heat, weak moiſture, levity, tenuity, and fluidnes. 12. Fire is only intenſ heat, whether in Elements or mixtils; but no Element, Body, or Subſtance. 13. Heat in Air or Mixtils, is partly implanted at Creation, partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed or introduced by the Sun, Soil, and Elementar Fire if any ſuch be: but the implanted ſoon decais without ſupply of infuſed. 14. Compoſition is duple: 1. Of Matter with both ſorts of qualities, as in the Heavens and Elements: 2. Of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo qualified and new mixture of qualities ariſing from the other; as in al Bodies elſ. 15. The union of qualities in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is moſt ſimple, but in Mixtils more compound; as 'tis ſaid of Colors, that whitnes and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>es, are made with the various mixture of bright and dark: but middle colors riſe from the mixtures of whit and black. 16. The meaſure and maner of al Temperaments, is founded on the firſt Creation: from which primary patern if nature dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at in exceſſ or defect, a deformed Monſter is bred. 17. To beget a like is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of al activ qualities in Inanimats and Animats, as God bid them by his benediction to increaſ and multiply. 18. The qualities doo ſo diffuſe themſelfs and beget others, that they make the matter proportioned to exerciſe their forces or functions. 19. The formativ faculty is founded on the very qualities: which the more ſimple, ſo much the more uniform configuration they produce: but if compounded of diverſ qualities, they make more diverſity or difformity in figuring the material parts. 20. Mixtion the leſſ ſimple, the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; for 'tis a great Art to unite ſo many varieties of unlike qualities into one craſis or temper: but the more compound the weaker, becauſ it conſiſts of ſo many contrary qualities. 21. Ther is a recripocal propagation of Temperaments in Animats: <hi>viz.</hi> of the Seed, and life of the Seed. 22. The Prolifical power in the Seed, proceds not from any ſpiritual ſubſtance inherent in it; but only from a ſubtle temper of qualities in a pure ſpirituous matter. 23. This energy is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly in the Seed ſtil, but aſleep or unactiv, til it meet with a fit Patient or rather Coagent to excite that virtu: as the ſtrong ſpirits which ly hid in Barly, Wheat, Plants, Grain, or Seeds are eaſily extracted by deſtillation. 24. In Plants the Earth is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:168435:269"/> a Womb to bring forth Seeds, by ſupplying heat from the Sun and moiſture from Soil wherby the Spirits in Seeds ſwel, and extend the matter to fit proportion of ſeveral Figures. 25 In Egbreeders Male and Female muſt concur to make them fertil: but to hatch and inlifen them, any heat natural or artificial (if wel ordered) wil ſuffice: becauſ the yelk is moiſt enough, and needs only help of heat to rouz up the whits ſpirits. 26. In perfect Animal-begetters, both Sexes muſt actualy join to make one maſſ of Seed: which being aptly mixd, ſpirituous ſubſtance of that maſſ is blown up and augmented by heat of the Matrix and moiſture of menſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ual Blood: which begins to form the Birth, and in fine brings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to perfection. 27. To the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of living Creatures, Seed is not ſimply neceſſary; but a mixture of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fening qualities in fit matter wil ſerv: as ſundry Plants propagat ſans Seed, and ſom Animals of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>28. Summarily the Souls vegetant in Plants, and ſentient <note place="margin">Summary.</note> in Animals (whether general wherby they becom Plants and Animals, or ſpecial ſpecifical which diſtinguiſh them into Kinds) are only the nobler Temperament of more activ qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in a ſubtler matter, whether propagated of Seed, or other wais ingendered; but no ſubſtances. This needs no other proofs then thoſ already alleged to refute the Subſtantiality of Forms: but why Mans Soul ſhould be a ſubſtance rather then Beaſts (many of which are ſo intelligible and docible as moſt of ſimple People, witnes the dancing Horſ cald <hi>Aſinago</hi>) no ſatisfactory reaſon can be rendred in nature, ſav only ſom dark places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The reſult of al is, that no ſubſtance ever dies or periſhes: for matter is invariable, and al Forms of Inanimats, together with the Vegetant and Sentient Souls meer mortal accidents or temperaments: only Mans Soul is a ſubſtance or Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed or inſpired at firſt by God, which is immortal and livs of it ſelf for ever. Theſ are his Principles of new Philoſophy, touching the origin of Forms and Souls: which let every one reliſh as his palat affects. Now to anſwer Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If the Soul be only a Temperament, every natural Body that hath a tempered Craſis ſhal be Animat: but 'tis not ſo: <hi>Ergo</hi> a Soul is no Temperament.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:168435:270"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This Argument conſiſts of meer affirmativs in the ſecund Figure, and therfore is a filthy Paralogiſm: but every Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of Inanimats is not fit for a Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> A Temperament is changed according to age, place, and diet: but a Soul is not ſo changed: <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis no Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Forms are changed or varied gradualy, as foreſhewed: but in the argument is a duple error. 1. That it doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwen a total eſſential, and partil gradual change of Temperament: for in the total is not only a mutation but corruption of the Soul, and makes nothing to purpoſe: in the partil is a change more or leſſ, which doth not vary or alter the kind: as a tender young Plant being removed from its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soil to a Forren, grows better or worſ without changing the kind; yet the unity of Form remains, with an alteration in the degrees of perfection. 2. That a tranſition from other Animals to Man is improper: for if his Bodily temper change, yet the Soul being a diſtinct ſubſtance varies not: but in al elſ Soul and Temperament: are one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If the Soul be a Temperament, ther be in Animats ſo many Souls as Tempers: one of the rind and wood in Trees, another of Fleſh and bones in Animals: but in every Animat is one only Soul: <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis no Temperaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Peripatetics place two Souls at leaſt in every Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, and three in Animals; but diverſ forms in Inanimats eſſentialy diſtinct: ſo according to them 'tis no abſurdity to grant plurality of Souls: yet is ther no plurality of ſubſtances, but diverſity of Temperament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If the Soul be but a Temperament of humors and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; it could not bridle the Bodies paſſions or perturbations: but it doth and is not led by them: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This is tru in Mans Soul, which ſomtimes bridles or moderats paſſions, and ſomtimes yeelds to them: but in no other Animats, whoſ Soul not only folows, but is Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> That can be no Accident or Temperament, from which the nobleſt faculties and functions of imagining, remembring, and perceiving or judgin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enſitiv objects proced: but Beaſts Souls hav ſuch operations remblable to Mans: <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not Accidents.</p>
            <pb n="261" facs="tcp:168435:270"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Al ſuch operations are meerly Organical in a material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and depend on it: the Organ is a pure, cleer, activ Animal ſpirit ſited in the Brain as the ſeat of Senſation: which Spirit is not only the Organ, but firſt Principle therof. For in al Animal Spirits two things are found, <hi>viz.</hi> matter and mixture of lifely qualities: mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the firſt Subject and Organ of Senſ, qualities the firſt cauſ or origin; and in both commixd conſiſt al the faculties of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, imagination, and memory which Brutes hav. Theſ Spirits are the ſole Inſtruments of al Senſation: but no ſubſtance uſeth or ruleth them being the firſt cauſ of Senſ. That which they cal Soul, muſt be either material, or immaterial: if material, 'tis either purer then the Spirits, which cannot be, ſith they are pureſt; or viler and impurer, but 'tis abſurd to grant that to the baſer, which is denied to the beſt: if immaterial, let them anſwer al arguments alleged againſt Forms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 'Tis abov or beyond the power of pureſt matter, indued or inveſted with moſt exquiſit qualities to judg, remember, deſire, ſhun, &amp;c. but Brutes Souls doo al this: <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis not, nor is it more ſtrange that ſuch effects ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Temperament of Brutes Brains, then doo other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable properties (as in the Magnet and many mo ſimples) from Inanimats Temperament, which is weaker then Animals. Theſ are <hi>magnalia Dei</hi> Gods wonderful works, which Men muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, not inquire.</p>
            <p>Laſtly he treats of Mans Souls origin which was firſt in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Upſhot.</note> and ſole ſcope of this Subject or Speculation: touching whoſ eſſence, that 'tis a rational immortal ſubſtance or ſpirit; none but Atheiſts or Sadduces wil doubt: but of the origin is much diſpute.

Som that they be created by Angels. Som that they be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Soul of the World, and made of Celical Subſtance. Som that they conſiſt of Elements. Som that they are framed of Gods own ſubſtance. Som that they be produced by the Heavens as an extern Efficient. Som that they propagat ſucceſſivly one from another. Som that they are continualy created and infuſed in the Body by God like <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Soul, which is the common Tenet. Theſ two laſt Opinions (rejecting al the reſt as futilous and frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous) he debats more freely and fully, which he that liſts may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat:
